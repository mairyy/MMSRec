Title: Disney/Pixar Cars Riplash Racers Rip-Start Challenge Loop Trackset ; Description: Sponsored by Rusteze, this loop track is all about action. Features 4-car launcher in which you can load the ripcord, give it a quick pull and let it rip! Riplash Racers Lightning McQueen (included) goes head to head against a rival, sprinting off the line, down a straightaway and into a full 360 loop-the-loop to the finish. It's auto racing speed meets rollercoaster excitement! Test your skills by adjusting the loop to 8 different one inch settings to see if you can jump the longest gap! Raceway decor creates a track atmosphere: flags, Lightning McQueen's lightning bolt and number, and a banner at the finish line. Lightning McQueen can run it again and again-he never gets tired of stunts. Place three cars in the grand stands to cheer on Lightning McQueen. Grand stand can also be used as a stunt ramp to launch a car through the loop! Comes with complete track setup, Riplash Racers McQueen and ripcord. ;
