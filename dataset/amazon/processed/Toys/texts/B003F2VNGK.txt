Title: Diamond Select Toys Universal Monsters Select: The Mummy Action Figure ; Description: A Diamond Select Release. The first-ever extension to DST's award-winning "Select" line. And what better way to expand this specialty market exclusive line than with the iconic Universal Monsters? This soon-to-be-annual line debuted last month with the legendary Creature from the Black Lagoon. What monster could possibly join such legendary company? DST dug deep into the sands of antiquity and discovered Imhotep himself, The Mummy. Sculpted by legendary monster sculptor, Jean St Jean, with the added artistry of Select regular Rudy Garcia (who, like a craftsman of old sculpted the Mummy's detailed sarcophagus accessory), this is a dusty terror from a bygone era. The fans have already spoken, hailing this line as the most detailed and accurate depiction of the classic Universal Monsters ever, and this 7" depiction of the infamous Mummy is proof-positive of DST's dedication to bringing these iconic monsters to collectors. The Select version includes an exclusive paint scheme as well as the detailed accessory not available to the mass market. ;
