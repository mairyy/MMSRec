Title: Fisher-Price Medical Kit ; Description: Just what the doctor ordered: lots of accessories for great role-play fun. A stethoscope that really works. Plus a blood pressure cuff with a spinning gauge (big enough to fit grown-up patients.), a "sick-to-well" thermometer, pretend otoscope, spring-loaded syringe and a bracelet style bandage that all fits into a soft "doctor" bag for storage. (Lab coat not included.). ;
