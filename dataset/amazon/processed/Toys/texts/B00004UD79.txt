Title: Lamaze Play &amp; Grow: Celeste ; Description: Want to give your new baby the sun and the moon? Celeste has a  three-dimensional, yellow velour sun face with black embroidery on one  side, and an embroidered satin moon face on the other. Trimmed in  brightly colored, boldly patterned cotton prints, this is one visually  stimulating toy. Dangling from Celeste's round body are four stretchy  black-and-white polka dot ribbons with a different toy suspended at  each end. There's a yellow star teether, a square of purple velour with  an embroidered butterfly that rattles when shaken, a green velour  circle with embroidered ladybug that squeaks when pressed, and a  triangular plastic link. Celeste is easy to carry, too, thanks to a  crinkling fabric handle.--Tami Horiuchi ;
