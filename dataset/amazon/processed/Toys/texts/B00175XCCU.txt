Title: Geospace Walkaroo Stilts by Air Kicks - Light Weight ; Description: Perfect for anyone under 110 Lbs (adults or kids), the ergonomically correct design allows a &#x201C;stilt-ist&#x201D; to walk in a more natural, upright position that encourages play. They&#x2019;re made of sturdy aluminum (instead of the steel used in Walkaroo I), which makes them easier to carry and quicker to maneuver. As kids gain balancing skills, they can move the footrests higher for more challenge. ;
