Title: Kenson Kids - &quot;I Can Do It&quot; Reward and Responsibility Chart Made in the USA. 11&quot; X 15.5&quot; ; Description: Having trouble getting your kids to pick up after themselves? Are you endlessly prompting them to do their homework? Wouldn't you love to hear please and thank you more often? The "I Can Do It!" Reward Chart can help!
Children thrive on praise and a little incentive goes a long way. This chart gives parents the tools to help raise more responsible, self- reliant kids.

Our chart grows with your child and is made for years of use.  We offer additional chores and behaviors (sold separately) so that you have over 75 tasks to choose from in all!
   
Unlike other chore charts, the "I can do it!" Reward Chart is easy to use and has fun colorful pictures to go along with the tasks to help the child associate words with the task.

Kids develop a positive self-esteem and sense of independence when they feel they are contributing to the family and can make their own choices. Motivating instead of trying to control your child's behaviors will help mold him or her to be the best they can be. The best parenting books have been stressing these concepts for years. The "I Can Do It!" reward chart brings some of these valuable lessons to life.
