Title: Bicycle Shadow Masters BLACK Deck of Playing Cards by Ellusionist ; Description: Each card hand designed in precise detail
The legend of the Masters deck redefined with a sleek black finish.

2 Gaff cards included for out-of-the-box trick readiness

SPECIAL FEATURES
JOKERS... if death was a gentleman, this is who he would look like. One Joker holds the sands of time in his hand while the other Joker changes it to a three of diamonds REVEAL.

EXTRA CARDS - there is one standard "ad card" from Ellusionist, but one card is a DOUBLE BACKER. (A gift to our cardworker fans, enjoy.)

BARCODE REVEAL: the tuck box contains a barcode reveal of the three of spades. Use it wisely.

FINISH: classic glide and durability of the USPC air-cushion finish is perfect for spreading and fanning. XCM'ers will love them. As usual, a plush and expensive USPC stock is used to create this quality driven product. ;
