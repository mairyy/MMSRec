Title: Uncle Milton Star Theater Home Planetarium ; Description: Here&#x92;s a rare indoor toy that&#x92;s likely to make kids excited to get outside. The Star Theater II home planetarium can be used inside a darkened room to project a vast panorama of stars on the walls and ceilings. It comes equipped with an audio CD to guide budding astronomers through the learning process as well as a hand held "meteor maker" which allows you to reenact meteors without waiting around for decades to see them. We found the scientific information helpful, accurate, and, best of all, approachable for even novice stargazers. The kit can also be brought outside to illuminate (rather than project) and serve as a map to the heavens.--Charlie Williams ;
