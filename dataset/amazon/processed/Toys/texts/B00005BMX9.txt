Title: Fisher-Price Little People Airport Playset - Red ; Description: The airport is a fascinating place to young children and it''s not hard to understand why: all those enormous airplanes, people coming and going, suitcases, and luggage carousels. It''s all pretty amazing. So kids are likely to love this fun airport set from Fisher-Price''s Little People collection. It sports an orange plane, helicopter, taxicab, windsock, control tower, radar dish, restaurant area, binocular stand, and more fun airport features. It''s compatible with all other Little People sets (and, frankly, it puts the ever-expanding Little People city on the map as a major metropolis). This would make a terrific present for any kid who has an actual airline trip ahead of them.--Charlie Williams ;
