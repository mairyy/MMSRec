Title: Galt Super Marble Run ; Description: The shortest distance between two points may be a straight line, but what fun is that? This 60-piece construction set will stimulate and challenge kids to create a variety of colorful marble runs. Made of sturdy red, yellow, and blue slot-together plastic, the kit contains enough pieces to create one large marble transportation system or lots of small structures. Send a marble rolling through a snake pass, spinning through the rotary drop, or around a curve. Marbles included--just add imagination and gravity!--Sharon Oshima ;
