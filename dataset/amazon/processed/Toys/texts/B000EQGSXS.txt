Title: VTech - V.Smile Baby - Infant Development System ; Description: Engaging, expandable, and fun, the V.Smile Baby Infant Development System connects your child to a world of interactive learning. A colorful activity panel lined with a soft bumper is baby&#x92;s touchable playcenter, filled with colorful shapes, a rolling ball, and jumbo button. Play-Alone mode allows baby to explore the sounds and activities on the panel, or plug the console into the television and the panel connects wirelessly to interact with the animated learning environment they see on the screen. Designed for children from nine to 36 months old, V.Smile Baby teaches numbers, shapes, music, colors, animals--even baby sign language--all with the help of engaging Smartridges like the one included (others are sold separately). Three activity modes allow the system to grow, as parents and children find age-appropriate play. Measuring approximately 8 by 14 by 2-1/2 inches, the wireless panel proves perfectly lap-worthy, although we wish it included a handle for the inevitable toting around by toddlers.--Heather Lyndon ;
