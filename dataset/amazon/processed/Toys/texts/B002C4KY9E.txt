Title: Sprig Toys Eco Recycling-Truck ; Description: The sturdy green recycling truck from innovative toy makers Sprig is made of their trademarked "Stigwood" -- an composite of reclaimed wood and recycled plastic. Like other Sprig toys, it's not painted. Instead, it's dyed during the production process with safe pigments that have no heavy metals in them. This truck is good for the environment, and a joy to play with it too. A recycling bin is included that can be picked up and emptied into the truck, and there are plenty of other moving parts to keep children ages two and older entertained.Recycling TruckAges:2+ ;
