Title: Fisher-Price Star Station Entertainment System ; Description: Now your child can be a rock star on TV. With the Star Station Entertainment System kids sing into the microphone to perform favorite songs, all while watching and hearing their performance "live" on the television screen. The base unit uses plug-n-play technology to easily hook up to your TV, allowing performers to see and hear themselves as they put on their show. You can even record performances by connecting to a VCR or DVD player as well if your TV has audio/video input jacks.Plug-n-play technology lets the base easily hook up to your TV.The base has a controllable camera with five different lenses that create cool video effects, and the base&#x92;s oversized, kid-friendly buttons make it simple for small hands to control all the action. The four buttons include play, pause, volume control, and song selection. The system comes with one cartridge with four recognizable sing-along tunes: If You&#x92;re Happy and You Know It, Row Row Row Your Boat, This Old Man, and The Wheels on the Bus. When kids (or parents) grow tired of these songs, there are eight additional cartridges that can be purchased separately, or the device can be hooked up to a CD or MP3 player if kids have other favorites.Wireless microphones let the action move around the room.This entertainment system also includes two wireless microphones, which means double the fun. Kids can invite friends over to play, parents can join in, harmonies can be added, or solo performers can just hold one in each hand. The fact that they&#x92;re wireless is ingenious. This allows budding pop stars to dance around as they sing, means they don&#x92;t have to be two inches from the TV screen, and, most of all, means there are no cords for tripping over, ripping out, or taking up space when not in use.One base unit, two wireless microphones, and one music cartridge are included. The necessary six AA and three AAA batteries are not. ;
