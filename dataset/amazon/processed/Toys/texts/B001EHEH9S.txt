Title: Bruder Conveyor Belt ; Description: This Bruder Conveyor Belt distinguishes itself by its attractive design and its lifting and conveying mechanisms that are easy to use thanks to the installed crank. The mechanisms can be used to lift hay bales onto the trailer and transport them to the barn as well as transport and unload sand into dump trucks. The conveyor belt can, of course, also be hooked on to all Bruder towing vehicles such as tractors, Unimogs, dump trucks including the Sprinter and construction vehicles equipped with a drawbar coupling. ;
