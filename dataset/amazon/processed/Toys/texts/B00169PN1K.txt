Title: K'NEX Education - Forces, Energy &amp; Motion ; Description: Off to the races with K'NEX Education! The K'NEX Education Forces, Energy & Motion set has been designed for students to investigate a variety of concepts related to forces, energy, and motion. These concepts are fashioned around rigorous STEM content and national standards in science, technology, engineering and math. As students engage in the activities, they will be learning, practicing, and applying integrated process skills. Students will be expected to craft fair test procedures, create meaningful data displays, make reasonable and data supported reports, and analyze their collected data in light of the problem at hand.  Set includes 442 K'NEX parts, along with a Battery, Spring and Fly-wheel motor &#x2013; enough to build 11 vehicles, up to four at a time. Supports 12- 16 students working in teams. Grades 5 - 9. Building instructions comprehensive teacher's guide aligned to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Standards included. Packaged in a strong storage tray with snap-on lid.  STEM Education focuses on science, technology, engineering and mathematics concepts taught through problem-solving, discovery, exploratory learning and critical thinking. STEM Education requires students to be active participants in the learning. K'NEX models offer hands-on learning opportunities that encourage scientific inquiry, investigation and experimentation. Our inquiry-based lessons challenge students as they build, investigate, problem solve, discuss, and evaluate scientific and design principles in action. Aligned to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math standards. ;
