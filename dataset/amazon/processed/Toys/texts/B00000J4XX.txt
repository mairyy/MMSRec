Title: Triangles ; Description: Clicky-clack, twist it this way, twist it that! Two colorful, linked  wooden triangles are a delightfully simple infant toy, bound to offer hours  of engaging, interactive fun for babies just beginning to develop  basic hand-eye coordination. Each triangle is constructed of three smoothly sanded,  colorful, rounded beads. When loose, but still connected, they rattle gently;  when snapped together by their connecting elastic cord, the triangles make a  flexible, twistable toy, just right for taste-testing by teething babies.--Marianne Painter ;
