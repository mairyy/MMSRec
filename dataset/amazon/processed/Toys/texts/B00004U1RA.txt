Title: Equate: The Equation Thinking Game ; Description: Equate looks a bit like Scrabble--for aspiring mathematicians,  that is. Designed by a real mathematician, it works like this: You put  down tiles on a board and make points by correctly completing simple  equations. Your nine tiles include both numbers and mathematical  symbols; you can add on to previous plays both vertically and  horizontally. Learn simple stuff (like what division is) and more  sophisticated ideas (like the order of precedence among arithmetic  operations). It all adds up.--Richard Farr ;
