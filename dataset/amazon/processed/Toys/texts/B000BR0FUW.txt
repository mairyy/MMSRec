Title: Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Giggling Troublesome Trucks ; Description: The Troublesome Trucks are the rascals of Sir Topham Hatt's Railway who take great delight in causing trouble for whichever engine has to pull them. Noisy and silly, they talk a lot and do not attend to what they are doing. The Troublesome Trucks are actually mixed goods wagons, so they can be used at all areas on the island, but especially enjoy causing trouble at the coal mines and quarries. ;
