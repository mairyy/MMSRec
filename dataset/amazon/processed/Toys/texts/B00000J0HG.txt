Title: Classic Etch A Sketch Magic Screen ; Description: Some classics never lose their appeal! Nested in a colorful, open-faced box, this old friend has the same bright red plastic frame, the same horizontal and vertical knobs, and the same inviting gray drawing screen as the original model. And as always, this Classic Etch A Sketch will provide hours of pencil-free drawing as its owner masters the right-left and up-down movements required. The magic screen upon which your drawings appear is glass, covered with protective clear plastic film. Inside, aluminum powder and plastic beads respond to each turn of the knobs. Owners are encouraged to join the Etch A Sketch club and receive a membership card, an official club patch, and a newsletter three times a year.--Liane Thomas ;
