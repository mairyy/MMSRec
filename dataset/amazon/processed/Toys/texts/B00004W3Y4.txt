Title: Do A Dot Art Marker Rainbow 6-pack ; Description: Parents like to encourage children in creative art activities, but sometimes  painting projects can be a little overwhelming. (The bottles, the brushes, the inevitable  spills, etc.) This handy-dandy art set provides six bright paint colors in sponge-tip bottles  that serve as the paint applicators. Best of all, these paints are spill-proof with no mess at  all. Each 5-inch bottle contains 2.5 ounces of paint in purple, green, red, yellow, blue, or  orange. The sponge tip creates a neat dot of paint about .5 inches wide, and the paint dries  quickly so colors can be layered. There's a wide range of creative possibilities here,  including creating borders for school projects and using the paint markers for patterning  activities that reinforce math concepts. An art idea sheet is also included with the set.--Marcie Bovetz ;
