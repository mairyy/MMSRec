Title: ParkZone Night Vapor BNF ; Description: Like the original Vapor aicraft, the Night VaporTM model is slow enough and light enough to fly in a living room, a basement or even the conference room at work. To this amazing slow flight performance, it adds the fun of LED lights that allow you to fly in the dark. It also features a new modular design that makes replacement of broken parts quicker and easier. Best of all, you can have the Night Vapor BNF flying in as little time as it takes you to charge its battery and bind it to a DSM2 aircraft transmitter (sold separately). ;
