Title: Woodstock Percussion ZENERGY3 Zenergy Chime, Trio Percussion Instrument ; Description: Tapped gently with the rubber-tipped mallet, this three-tone chime emits a soothing "voice" that relaxes and reenergizes. Useful for meditation and healing rituals, the chime can be struck in front of the body, then moved from one side of the head to the other for a  surround-sound experience. Three polished aluminum rods of different lengths are fastened to a smooth, cherry-finished hardwood base that measures approximately 8 by 3 inches, small enough to keep on a desk or by the bed. Musician Gary Kvistad founded Woodstock Chimes in 1979, and today the family-owned company produces a wide range of handcrafted, precision-tuned chimes. A one-year warranty covers the chime against defects, and all tuned Woodstock Chimes come with a lifetime tuning guarantee.--Ann Bieri ;
