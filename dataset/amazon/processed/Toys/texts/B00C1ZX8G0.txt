Title: Madame Alexander My Little Sweetheart 14&quot; Baby Doll, Sweet Baby Nursery Collection ; Description: My Little Sweetheart. She, a little sweetie, with a light blonde page boy-topknot combo and blue eyes, wears a two-piece outfit. The top pairs a ribbed, cream velour bodice with a skirt and sleeves made from a cream knit printed with pink hearts. Lace trim on the sleeves, a lace trimmed ruffle at the hem and pink binding at the neck add pretty accents to the top, as does the appliqued heart in the center of the bodice. The pink knit pants, worn with the top, are gathered into ruffles at the ankle and have an elastic waist. A pink satin ribbon on her hair completes My Little Sweetheart. Her rooted hair can be brushed, styled and combed. ;
