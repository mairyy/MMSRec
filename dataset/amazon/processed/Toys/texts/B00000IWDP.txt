Title: Don't Spill the Beans ; Description: After a grownup snaps this smiling red plastic bean pot together, it stands 5 inches tall. The trick  is for two to four young children to drop beans onto the pot's lid, one by one, without spilling them. The  more beans there are, the more care they must take. If--well, actually,when--they upset the balance  of the pot, they spill the beans. And naturally everyone squeals and has a good time. The first person to get  rid of all their beans is the winner. This is a fun game for young children, and no reading is required to  play, but be sure to keep those beans out of reach of kids who are still apt to put things other than real food  in their mouths.--Rebecca Hughes ;
