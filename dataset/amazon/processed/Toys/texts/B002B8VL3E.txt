Title: Flickin' Chicken ; Description: How do you Flick your Chicken? Imagine rubber chickens meet miniature golf. Players take turns throwing the target disc and then flick their chickens at the disc. Where the chicken lands is where the player flicks it again until the chicken hits the target. Beware these chickens bounce and roll so you never know how many flicks it will take. The number of flicks it took to land on the target is your score for that round. The player with the lowest score after nine rounds of Chicken Flickin insanity is the winner. ;
