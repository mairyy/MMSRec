Title: Cranium Balloon Lagoon ; Description: Step right up, boys and girls, for the greatest game in the living room! Balloon Lagoon, designed by the creators of Cranium, is possibly more fun than the carnival it emulates. After all, there's no sticky cotton candy mess, no nauseating rides&#x85;but plenty of entertaining activity for everyone. A noisy musical merry-go-round timer keeps the pressure on while players take turns fishing for letters to spell words, collecting matching snacks at the Snack Hut, pressing levers to spin wheels to unscramble pictures, or flipping frogs back into their pond. Players keep score by collecting little plastic balloons--the first person to fill a mover piece with 15 balloons wins. The game includes game board, timer, four carnival games, four player movers, 72 scoring balloons, and a balloon bag. Three AA batteries required (not included). You can pretty much assume that if it's Cranium, it's going to be a blast!--Emilie Coulter ;
