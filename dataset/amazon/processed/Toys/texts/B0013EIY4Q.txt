Title: Monkey Podgames, Tangram Puzzle ; Description: The shroud of ancient Chinese mystery and folklore has kept this brain teaser at the forefront of international interest throughout the years, attracting the attention of varied greats from Edgar Allen Poe to Napolean. Perhaps adapted from the yanjitu furniture set of seven tables popular during Song Dynasty China, or born of the legend of a sloppy imperial servant who shattered an expensive tray into seven tan-like pieces, we prefer the great American puzzlist, Sam Lloyd's spoof claim that it was invented 4,000 years ago by the God "Tan". The object is to arrange all seven pieces called "tans" into one of many possible forms and shapes that contain all seven pieces in a non-overlapping manner - a tantalizingly difficult task, but also extremely satisfying upon completion. Comes with a wooden box, matching lid, and several silhouettes with which to try out your tanabilities.
