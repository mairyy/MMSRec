Title: The Walking Dead TV Board Game ; Description: In The Walking Dead Board game, only the strong survive. The weak turn into walkers, and then turn against their former friends. Fight your way through zombie-infested Atlanta with your fellow survivors. Grab some weapons to clear a path. Visit destinations like the department store, old folk&#x2019;s home, and the CDC. Find the tools you&#x2019;ll need to live another day. Take on the role of Rick, Andrea, or one of the other hapless survivors and scrounge for sweet weapons like a Shotgun or Crossbow. Keep your eyes open for new allies, but watch your back. When supplies start running low, it&#x2019;s every man for himself. If you can make it back to camp with enough gear to defend yourself and those you still care for, you win. ;
