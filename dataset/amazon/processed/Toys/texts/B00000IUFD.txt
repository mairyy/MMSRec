Title: Family Pastimes / Max - A Co-operative Game ; Description: This board game doesn't pit players against each other in competition. Instead, all players work cooperatively to get a bird, a chipmunk, and a mouse (collectively known as Little Creatures) safely home before Max the Tomcat catches them and, presumably, eats them!  The dice have single spots--either black or green--on each face. Black spots move Max, green spots move the Little Creatures.  Players roll the dice and, in consultation with each other, decide which pieces to move in a game-long effort to foil Max. A refreshing twist on more traditional board games, this is a win/win situation for the players. They will undoubtedly always be able to save at least some of the Little Creatures from Max! Children might need help from an adult in separating the cardboard game pieces.  The full-color game board is 12 inches square.--Wendy Slotboom ;
