Title: Melissa &amp; Doug Rainbow Garden See Through Window Art ; Description: This guided arts-and-crafts activity gives young artists everything they need to create a shimmering "stained glass" light catcher. The results are gorgeous: Shaped sticker-gems depict a hummingbird, flower and butterfly beneath a rainbow-filled sky. Hang the finished artwork in a sunny window to see this pretty scene shimmer to life. It's easy to create: Just match the stickers to the number key and place them on the see-through design template. Young artists will be enchanted by the glittering results, and proud to show them off in the ready-to-hang frame. ;
