Title: Fisher Price Learning Home ; Description: There&#x92;s no one in the world busier than babies and toddlers. But even the most curious and active little explorer may have met their match with this entertaining two-sided play house. On the "outdoor" side, there are doorbell chimes, a rolling garden display, a flower that grows, a mailbox for letters, a sun and moon dial, and more. "Indoor" features include a light switch and a singing clock. There are 21 songs, all of which are easily heard, electronic, and activated by touching, tweaking, or pulling parts of the play set. Our favorite component involved dropping balls down a water spout to hear the itsy-bitsy spider song.--Charlie Williams ;
