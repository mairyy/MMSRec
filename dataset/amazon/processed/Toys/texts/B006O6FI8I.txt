Title: Fisher-Price Imaginext Castle Catapult ; Description: The Imaginext Castle Large Catapult is one of the exciting new Castle Feature Vehicles. It features our newly developed &#x201C;Action Tech&#x201D; technology allowing the castle to recognize and respond to the vehicle with the twist or press of the disk. The Catapult is designed to roll into battle and support the knights trying to get in. You can press down on the disc and fire one of three boulders towards the castle. When you release the disc, the next boulder automatically moves into position. With either a twist or press of the disc, the castle will also call out to warn the knights within the castle of impending fire. In addition to working with the Castle, the Catapult also has cool battling sound effects that will reward and surprise as the activation disk is pressed. ;
