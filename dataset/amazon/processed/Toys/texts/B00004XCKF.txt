Title: Little Tikes Cookin' Sounds Gourmet Kitchen Cuisine ; Description: Cook up a storm (or a symphony) with this 11-sound electronic  kitchen center. Young chefs will enjoy preparing a gourmet extravaganza  at the stove and microwave console, complete with light-up burners and  three cooking sounds. When they turn on the faucet to clean up, they'll  hear running water. And they can chat with their friends on the phone,  which has four additional sounds and sits in a convenient stove-side  bracket when not in use. Altogether there are 15 accessories, including  cups, plates, knives and forks, and a frying pan. The main unit is  approximately 42 inches high, 38 inches wide, and 18 inches deep and  has several shelves and a removable cutting board. The screw-together  construction requires adult assembly; four AA batteries (not included)  are required for the lights and sound effects. Ah, the sound of onions  sizzling in a frying pan--bon app&eacute;tit!--Richard  Farr ;
