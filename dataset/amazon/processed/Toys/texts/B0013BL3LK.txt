Title: Elenco Electronics Snap Circuits Snaptricity ; Description: Following the same experiment pattern of other Snap Circuits kits, Snaptricity teaches you how electricity and magnetism work and how they can be used to make each other. Learn about magnetic fields, how the electricity in your home works, how switches control the electricity to the lights in your home, and how series and parallel circuits affect electricity. Snaptricity uses the same "snap" connectors of Snap Circuits to bring electricity and magnetism theories into the practical home. ;
