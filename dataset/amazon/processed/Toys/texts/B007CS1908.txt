Enchanting games throughout the eBook propel the action forward and guide the story toward a fairytale ending.Self-Adjusting Story Levels for a Perfect FitChildren can engage with the Cinderella story in Read Me mode, Read with Me mode or Read on My Own mode. In Read to Me mode, children hear the entire text read aloud for a non-stop storytelling experience. In the Read with Me mode, a narrator reads the story pausing on each page to allow time for the play/learn activities. In the Read on My Own mode, children read the text on their own and can even record and replay their own voice for each page, replacing the narrator&#x2019;s voice. As children complete word-based and comprehension-based activities, their scores help suggest a text level that provides the appropriate level of challenge. Different story levels auto-adjust to the reader and introduce increasingly complex spelling patterns with high-frequency sight words. Or, children can choose to engage with text above their recommended level, which allows exposure (with audio support) to even richer language and more sophisticated sentence structures while promoting listening comprehension.LeapFrog&#x2019;s &#x201C;Magic Wand&#x201D;LeapFrog learning games, apps and eBooks are designed and approved by our in-house educational experts and grounded in the latest research for the richest possible learning experience. Promoting learning through play taps into children&#x2019;s natural curiosity and inspires them to explore.
