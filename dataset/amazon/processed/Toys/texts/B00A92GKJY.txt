Title: Transformers Generations Legends Class Optimus Prime and Autobot Roller Figures ; Description: BY HASBRO INC.  Autobot Roller has been the constant companion of Optimus Prime for all the countless years of the war. Silently, patiently, he has stood by the Autobot commander, supporting him as a leader, and serving him as a warrior. For all intents and purposes, Autobot Roller is a part of Optimus Prime, and just as great a hero. This Autobot duo is just what you need to jump-start your Transformers adventures! Your Optimus Prime figure is the great Autobot leader, and he converts easily from robot mode to semi truck mode and back. But your Autobot Roller figure is Optimus Prime&#x2019;s powerful ally. He converts from robot to vehicle mode and back, and he also pops into weapon mode! Keep converting them both from one mode to another so their Decepticon enemies can&#x2019;t keep up!
