Title: Harrisville Designs 7&quot; Potholder (Traditional Size) Loom Kit ; Description: Do you remember making potholders when you were a kid? It's as much fun as ever with this classic craft kit. In addition to a sturdy, 7-square-inch metal loom, the kit includes simple instructions, a plastic hook, and enough cotton loops to make three to four potholders. (You also get a form for ordering additional loops.)  Children learn basic weaving skills while building hand-eye coordination and manual dexterity. They also experience the satisfaction of creating their own colorful designs. Weaving potholders is a good quiet-time activity for rainy days, long car trips, or sick time. And kids feel proud to offer their creations as gifts or to sell at school fundraisers.--Joan DeClaire ;
