Title: Small World Toys Preschool (They Keep Multiplying!) ; Description: Need some help with those tricky multiplication tables? This simple educational tool helps kids develop math skills by giving them an easy learning guide. Designed as a simple grid of square plastic buttons, nine across and nine down, each button in the keyboard represents an individual multiplication problem. Push a square--4 x 5, say--and the correct answer magically appears--20! Kids can test themselves, or take turns with parents or friends to make a game of it. A great plus: no moving parts or batteries. Measuring 9 inches by 8.5 inches, the keyboard is made of durable, lightweight plastic, easy to take on a trip or tuck in a backpack.--Marianne Painter ;
