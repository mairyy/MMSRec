Title: Great Horned Owl Puppet ; Description: Tall and silent with curving "horns" and stern-looking, yellow eyes, the Folkmanis Great Horned Owl puppet possesses a disturbing beauty. At night, in the dark when we have trouble seeing, he startles us with a sudden "Who-who-whoooo." And we are glad we are not smaller than he. This magnificently crafted puppet features feather-like plush, movable wings, a rotating head and blinking eyes. Ideal for use in interactive stage and puppet theater, Folkmanis Puppets are also great for teaching, daycare, school, pretend play, games and parties, or to pair with a book for storytelling. Easy to feed and care for, just add lots of love and snuggly fun. This puppet measures 9 x 5 x 18 inches (LxWxH). Folkmanis has been encouraging young imaginations to blossom since 1976 with its innovative and engaging specialty puppets, promoting creativity and discovery while winning nearly every industry, child development, and kid-tested award. Folkmanis has grown to become the premier manufacturer of plush puppets worldwide, offering over 200 of the most heartwarming and realistically designed creatures--both exotic and familiar--on the market today.
