Title: Fisher-Price E-L-M-O ; Description: Elmo may not be on the cutting edge of pop culture with this incarnation, but he still makes playtime fun. Instead of mimicking the latest hit, which always seems to drive kids wild, he sings and dances his own version of a 70s classic: "YMCA." It never dies, does it? The 13.5-inch Elmo sings out letters to a catchy rhythm while dancing what can only be described as pseudo-Egyptian. It's quite a feat, actually, to see what he does with his arms and legs: standing on one foot, bobbing his head, moving several limbs at once. His cute, familiar voice hasn't changed, either; kids can hear it with each press of his upheld hand. Required: 4 AA batteries.Diane Beall ;
