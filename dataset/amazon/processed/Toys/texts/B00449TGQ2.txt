Title: Fushigi Ball Gravity Ball ; Description: Fushigi is a brand new, dynamically designed ball used in the mysterious art of contact juggling. With Fushigi the operator exploits the reflective properties of a sphere through specific hand and body isolations and movements that are designed to give the appearance that the Fushigi sphere is moving on its own or even floating. Using Fushigi is an incredible, therapeutic form of relaxation. The art of maneuvering a reflective sphere through mind and body isolation and manipulation creates the illusion that the sphere may be defying the laws of gravity, as if the sphere is moving on its own. ;
