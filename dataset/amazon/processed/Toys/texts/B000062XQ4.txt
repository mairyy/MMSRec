Title: LeapFrog Imagination Desk Learning System ; Description: Here's another great LeapFrog innovation that lets children play and learn at the same time. The Imagination Desk Learning System teaches kids letters, numbers, phonics, counting, and vocabulary on a lively multimedia desk. As a child colors in the pages, they come to life with characters, games, and music that teach letters, colors, and other preschool skills. Three engaging modes (learn, game, and music) offer tons of variety for kids as they play, extending both the fun and appeal of the desk. The set includes the interactive learning desk, the "Let's Learn Letters" coloring book, and crayons. The unit features volume control, storage for templates and supplies, and a carrying handle. It uses four AA batteries (not included). ;
