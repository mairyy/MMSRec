Title: Transformers Reveal the Shield Deluxe Action Figure Wreckgar ; Description: Wreck-Gar is obsessed with Earth television, and may be just a little bit flaky. He communicates almost exclusively in quotes from commercials and late-night movies, and the grin on his face never fades, even in the heat of battle. Most Autobots have no idea what he&#x2019;s talking about most of the time, but they appreciate having his axe on their side. Turn the tables on enemy forces when you throw this warrior into the fight! Press the button to reveal this figure&#x2019;s robot allegiance and then prepare him for a battle. Your Wreck-Gar figure is dedicated to destroying any opponent and his four-bladed battle axe will help you two get the job done. If robot combat turns into a car chase, convert your warrior into motorcycle vehicle mode and send him racing off to rule the road! ;
