Title: My Little Pony Butterfly Island Adventure Playset with 3 Bonus Ponies ; Description: When My Little Pony wants a magical adventure far from her regular pasture, she heads for Butterfly Island. In this tropical oasis, ponies can prance around the colorful, butterfly-shaped island with their pals, play in the waves, build sandcastles, or head for the smoothie bar for a tasty treat; it&#x92;s all about having fun in the sun! Pop a pony on the surfboard and spin the wheel for a ride, while dolphins leap alongside. Hang snorkels and a "grass" skirt on the butterfly stand and the souvenir booth is ready for business. When life on the ground gets dull, ponies can ride up over the rainbow, then slide down the waterfall for a magical circuit. Best of all, with the help of a snap-on butterfly saddle, My Little Pony can fly through the air on the mountaintop butterfly ride, high above the island, to the sounds of a tropical tune. The play set includes the special Pegasus pony, Honolu-Loo, and three bonus ponies, all bearing colorful manes and distinctive hindquarter tattoos. Although a magnetized foot helps keep ponies on their perches during rides, sudden movements can send ponies flying off in an unscripted manner. Set includes four pony figures, clothes rack, palm tree, road signs, smoothie bar, sandcastle mold, sandcastle, shovel, sand pail, snorkel mask, four flippers, "grass" skirt, and brush. When playtime&#x92;s finished, pieces can be stored in the back of the mountain for easy cleanup. Requires two AA batteries (not included).--Heather Lyndon ;
