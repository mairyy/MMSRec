With slide-lock air track pieces that are simple to put together, assembly only takes a few minutes. Kids are sure to be impressed by the bright colors and the twisting track right away.Before take-off you'll need to use a Philips head screwdriver to install six AAA batteries (not included) -- three in Jumbo the jet and three in the remote control. Then snap Jumbo onto the track and set him in motion. The remote control has two buttons, so kids can set Jumbo spinning forward or backward on the air track loop. Designed to be easy for kids to grasp with two hands, the controller is shaped like a real plane's controller for increased fun.Durable, Colorful, and Easy-to-ExpandIt's easy to see why the GeoTrax system is a big hit with both parents and kids. A durable, colorful set that promises to jump-start active imaginations, the High Flyin' Airport offers stations around the base of the tower to inspire adventures below the air track. Kids can fill up a gas tank, set stairs for passengers to board a plane, or keep an eye on the security gate. The Pilot Jim figure can sit inside the Jumbo plane, ride the moving elevator to the top of the control tower, or wait for a train ride home. And the plane itself can be pushed along or driven with the remote control, providing lots of options for creative play.When friends, siblings, and parents want to get involved in the action, they may be disappointed that this set only includes one vehicle and one figure. But since the airport is compatible with other sets in the GeoTrax system, you can expand it to create a whole GeoTrax community with more vehicles, figures, and places for them to visit. Whether you have one set or many, GeoTrax offer a great opportunity for future pilots and engineers to play alone or cooperatively.What's in the BoxMain tower, terminal base, traffic control top, loading station, air track with tabs, air track with support, four standard air track pieces, security gate, trestle base, trestle post, remote control, Jumbo jet, and pilot Jim figure. ;
