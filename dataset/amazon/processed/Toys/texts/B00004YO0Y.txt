Title: Let's Go Fishin' ; Description: The musical Let's Go Fishin' game is a test for the eyes, hands,  ears, and patience. As the pond circles the base (to the tune of "Row,  Row, Row Your Boat") see how many more colorful fish you can catch than  your fellow players. The trick is that the fish are moving up and down  as they circle, as well opening and closing their mouths. Can you time  it just right and bring home dinner? This game for one to four players  includes four fishing poles, the musical game base (which can rotate  with or without music), 21 colorful fish, and complete instructions.  Requires two AA batteries (not included).--Heather Hawkins ;
