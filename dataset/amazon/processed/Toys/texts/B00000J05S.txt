Title: My First Colorforms - Little Miss Weather Dress Up Set - University Games ; Description: This set is perfect for preschoolers who are just learning about the  thrill of color forms. The larger pieces make it possible for young hands to  peel back the pictures "all by myself." Miss Weather also teaches children  about choosing clothes based on the weather outside--an activity that  preschoolers don't always like to cooperate with. However, children will  certainly cooperate with dressing Miss Weather in all her gear, including a  red snowsuit, summer rollerblading outfit, yellow rain slicker, and pink  bathing suit. Since Miss Weather is posed next to a big picture window,  children can even stick on some weather color forms, including a shining sun,  autumn leaves, blooming flowers, or flakes of snow. This set teaches children  about dressing appropriately, but more importantly, they will feel  competent and smart as they maneuver these easy-peel color forms.--Gail  Hudson ;
