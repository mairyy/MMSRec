Title: I Spy Preschool Game ; Description: "I spy with my little eye" is the chiming chorus of road trips  with kids, and also now of this game for preschoolers. It develops  reading skills through colors, pictures--the high-impact compositions  of everyday stuff from theI Spybooks by Jean Marzollo--and  rhymes. Different games are possible with the same set of easy-to-read  cards: listening, rhyming, and matching. Older kids can play with their  younger, nonreading siblings without any rivalry. That's because, in  this game, everybody wins. But in order to succeed, you gotta stop,  look, and listen.--Lynne Sampson ;
