Title: ThinkFun Safari Rush Hour ; Description: This is a strategy game with a twist--if you lose, you're  lunch. You've taken your trusty Safari Rover deep into the bush; now  maneuver it through the maze of hungry animals and get back to camp in  one piece. An 8-by-7.25-inch plastic game tray forms a kind of grid for  your vehicle and the 3-D plastic animal pieces (including elephants,  rhinos, and a termite mound). Draw one of 50 cards (10 of which are  extra-easy, for younger players) to determine the initial board setup.  Then move pieces, according to strict rules, to make your escape  through the only exit. A cloth bag for all the game pieces is included.--Richard Farr ;
