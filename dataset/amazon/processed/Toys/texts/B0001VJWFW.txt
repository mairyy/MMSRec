Title: Kikkerland Sparklz Wind Up Gear Box ; Description: Sparklz thinks it is one of those Greek gods of lightning, but it's still trying to get the hang of thunder and rain. Meanwhile, Sparklz just wobbles around aimlessly with its little rudder, looking for a meaning in life. A straight descendent of the Japanese Critters from Mxyplyzyk, Sparklz actually hates fire. It loves nature and water, dense forests, and the creatures that live in it. Just to be on the safe side, you should keep Sparklz away from any flammable liquids, or vapors.  Body and key colors are assorted, we pick color based on availability.  Stainless steel spring and wheels. ;
