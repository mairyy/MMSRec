Title: Lego: Minifigures Series 3 &gt; Baseball Player Mini-Figure ; Description: "Let's get out there and give 'em a great game!" To the Baseball Player, nothing is as important as good teamwork. He memorizes all of his team's game strategies, pays close attention to the coach's signals, and does his best to help win no matter what position he's playing. It's not about personal fame or the number of home runs he hits - it's about everybody having a good time on the field, and giving the crowd in the stands a terrific game to watch. The Baseball Player isn't just a professional athlete; he's a big fan of the sport, too. He has an ever-growing collection of baseball memorabilia, from Bob Battingsley's original rookie card to the signed bat of the world-famous "Brick" Ruth himself. But his top favorite is his mint-in-package collection of historic baseball stadium hot dogs. He's almost got the complete set! ;
