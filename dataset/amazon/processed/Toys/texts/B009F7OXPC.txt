Title: WWE Rumblers Rampage Devastadium Playset ; Description: WWE Rumblers Rampage Devastadium Playset: The tougher they are, the harder they brawl, and WWE Rumblers figures are tough. This resettable stadium can barely contain the excitement as it gradually collapses. Figures can "punch" the boom camera into the TitanTron, "throw" each other into the tiered stands of Rumblers and "jump" into the breakaway lights. When the set hits its breaking point, it disintegrates into chaos. Kids can reset it easily for multiple matches and hours of mayhem. Includes playset, 1 Rumblers Rampage figure with a fighting move and 1 launchpoint. ;
