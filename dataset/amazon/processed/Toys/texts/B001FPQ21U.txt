Title: Connect 4 Spongebob Edition ; Description: Play your favorite four-in-a-row game the Bikini Bottom way!  Drop your checkers into the yellow and porous grid and try to make a line upwards, sideways, or diagonal. Block your opponent with checkers--or use your Spongebob Blocker to block many holes at once!  But look out--if your opponent's checkers stack to the top of the grid, they  can take away your SpongeBob Blocker! If you get four checkers in a row before your opponent --you win! Adult assembly required. Ages 6+ ;
