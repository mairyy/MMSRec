Title: Chicco Toys Play 'N Ride Train - Colors May Vary ; Description: All aboard! This ride-on or push toy (for engineers up to 3 feet tall) is a colorful train with some  unique features. On one side of the pretend smokestack funnel is a lever that makes a barber pole spin, on  the other a lever that makes a silly squeaky noise. The top of the funnel is a working steering wheel that has  a spinning top with colorful balls that bounce and clatter once you push the button. With a tall, removable  backrest that doubles as a push bar for beginning walkers--and a seat that opens up to a compartment to  hide important treasures--this is a great addition to any rail yard or playroom.--S.
