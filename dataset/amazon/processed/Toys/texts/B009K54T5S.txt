Title: LEGO Creator Expert Winter Village Cottage 10229 ; Description: Continuing the LEGO&#xAE; winter series, build the Winter Village Cottage for a perfect holiday home. Seat Grandpa snugly by the fireplace with his newspaper as you help Dad to put up the tree, then bake a feast in the kitchen with Mom! When it's time to stock up the storage shed with firewood, bring the kids for a ride with Dad on the sled to watch him cut the wood with his chainsaw deep in the forest. When the snow gets really deep, clear the road with the snowplow, take all of the kids skiing or build an igloo to play in. There's no cozier place to spend long, frosty nights! ;
