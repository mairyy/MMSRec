Featuring a car wash, pump station, and car elevator, this toy fosters imaginative play with fun phrases at every turn.Setup and DesignWith bright colors and popular Sesame Street characters, this adorable playset puts a smile on any child's face. All the pieces snap right into place and the instructions are clearly written so parents can get it up and running in no time. Once the garage is built, kids put the cars on the elevator platform and pull Oscar's head up. When the elevator reaches the top, the platform should tip forward, sending the cars down the ramp. However, instead of in one smooth motion, the Elmo and Cookie Monster cars require a push or two to get past the first curve. Another slight drawback parents should note is that the frame must be handled gently and might not stand up against rough toddler play.Car wash, pump station, and car elevator snap together quickly and easily.View larger.Colorful ramps bring the cars into the different sections.View larger.Fun with Sesame StreetNot only does this garage have all of the usual features enjoyed by young racers, it also incorporates some of Sesame Street's most beloved characters. With googly eyes and wide grins, the cars are miniature versions of Elmo and Cookie Monster. Boys and girls can race their cars down the Cookie speedway ramp or the Ernie car wash ramp, then gas up at the pump station. And the hose really fits the gas tank! Fun phrases accompany all the action and generate giggles from the youngsters. For quiet play, parents can shut the playset off with the on-off switch on the side.The Test DriveOverall the Giggle N Go is a great toy for little kids, but some basic design elements could be improved. For instance, the cars are too wide and instead of rolling right down the ramp, they need a push to get past the first curve. The cars also sometimes prematurely roll off the elevator platform. But once you hear Elmo say, "Time for an oil change," in his sing-song voice, you will forget about this playset's few weaknesses. It reaches its target age and engages kids for hours as they race cars down the ramps again and again. The Giggle N Go Garage measures 7-3/4 by 19 by 9-1/4 inches and requires three AA batteries.ProsFun phrases from Sesame Street charactersTwo ramps for racingElmo elevator brings cars to second levelHose really fits gas tanksConsCars are a bit too wide for the rampPoor construction makes it difficult to move set aroundCars can roll off elevator prematurelyWhat's in the Box1 garage, 1 small ramp, 1 support frame, 2 support arms, 2 circular ramps, 1 gas pump platform, 2 cars. ;
