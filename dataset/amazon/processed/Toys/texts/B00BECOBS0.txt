Title: TOMY Sweet Messages Photo Bug Electronic Learning Toy ; Description: The Sweet Messages Photo Bug by TOMY is the first ever talking photo album for babies, ensuring loved ones are never too far away. It holds up to eight pages with the unique ability to record a special message for each photo. It's a great way for distant relatives to become familiar faces and voices as baby grows up as they can hear their messages at the touch of a button. A colored button at the top of each page shows when a message is being recorded and when it's being played back. There are also two cute sound effects that are triggered when the album is shut; an authentic camera click and a baby giggle. The Sweet Messages Photo Bug also stands up so when it's not in use, it doubles as a photo frame. ;
