Title: McFarlane Toys The Walking Dead TV Series 4 The Governor Action Figure ; Description: AMC's The Walking Dead television series is now the most watched drama in basic cable history. Shattering records along the way with the release of each new season. Season 3 finds Rick Grimes and his fellow survivors continuing to seek refuge in a desolate and post-apocalyptic world and soon discover that there are greater forces to fear than just the walking dead. The struggle to survive has never been so perilous and McFarlane Toys is sitting shotgun for the ride with its forth series of AMC's The Walking Dead action figures. Each highly articulated human figure features the exact likeness of the actor by using a 3D scanning process and come with multiple accessories. And just like with the first three series of figures, each zombie included features an amazing attention to detail and unique play-action for maximum fun. The charismatic leader of the seemingly utopian town of Woodbury, The Governor plays the role of stern, but just, leader--a hero and source of confidence and hope to the people he protects. But, the role he plays and the man he truly is are too very different things. Beneath his well-meaning facade is a man capable of acts of violence and dread that could make even a Walker's skin crawl. This action-figure includes 22 points of articulation, an alternate head without eye patch, pistol with hip holster, hunting knife with sheath and large knife. ;
