Title: Barbie in the Pink Shoes Transforming Ballerina Kristyn Doll ; Description: Barbie in the Pink Shoes Transforming Ballerina Kristyn Doll: In the new movie Barbie in the Pink Shoes, Barbie stars as Kristyn Farraday, a beautiful ballerina whose magical pink shoes take her into a fantasy world of ballet. While journeying through this delightful world, Kristyn transforms into the beautiful and graceful ballet characters Giselle and Odette. This doll captures her dramatic transformation with a ballet costume that changes from an elegant purple and blue dance outfit to the stunning pink costume she wears in her final performance of the movie. Girls simply take her hand and turn the doll to twist her torso. As she rotates, her skirt reverses for a magical transformation. Twist her the other way to change back to the first outfit. Both skirts look darling with her pink glitter-detailed bodice. Ballet arms and sparkling ballet shoes are graceful dance details, and a tiara and necklace help complete her fantastical look. ;
