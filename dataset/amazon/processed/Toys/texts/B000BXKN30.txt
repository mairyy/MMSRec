Title: Doinkit&uml; Darts ; Description: The Doinkit&#xAA; Dart set was designed with one thing in mind... To develop the best playing magnetic dart set on the planet. We think we succeeded. Each of our acclaimed Doinkit&#xAA; Darts uses N-35 Neodymium rare earth magnets&#xAA; (Neodymium is a more expensive magnet than Aluminum Nickel Cobalt (Alnico) and of course much more costly than standard ceramic magnets). Combined with our space age Doinkit&#xAA; material that is light, durable and keeps the dart always flying perfectly true, we feel we have the perfect dart. This is the finest, most well designed and balanced magnetic dart set made at any price! Comes with 6 perfectly balanced (6.23 gms.) darts with Neodymium magnets that will work on any magnetic dartboard. ;
