Title: Reverse Charades ; Description: Reverse Charades is a hilarious twist on the classic game of charades. Instead of one person acting out a clue for a team to guess, in Reverse Charades, a team acts out clues for one person to guess. The goal is to guess as many words as possible in 60 seconds. It&#x2019;s a fast-paced, fiercely fun team completion that&#x2019;s an absolute riot for families, work teams, school groups, and party-goers. ;
