Title: LeapFrog Alphabet Pal&reg; Caterpillar (Colors May Vary) ; Description: Here's a learning toy that offers kids a wonderful, interactive introduction to  the world of letters, sounds, and colors. Alphabet Pal features several ways to play--pull  the string and, antennae flashing, the jolly green caterpillar rolls happily along singing the  alphabet song.  When one of the caterpillar's 26 multicolored alphabet legs is pressed,  kids hear the name of that color, letter, or letter sound depending on which mode they  choose. Best of all, Alphabet Pal is a parent's friend, too--it's not too loud and turns off by  itself when idle. It comes with three demonstration batteries, which should be replaced  with regular AA batteries. Made of durable plastic, the toy is 7 by 11.5 inches long.--Marianne Painter ;
