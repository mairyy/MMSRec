Title: Deluxe Pit ; Description: Looking for a sure winner in the hot commodities market? Pit, the fast-paced card game from Parker Brothers, has been a bullish performer since its introduction way back in 1904. With all the ups and downs, desperate deals, and nonstop action of an actual trading floor, this lively game offers great fun without risking the family fortune. The rules are simple: Deal the cards, wait for the opening bell, scream and trade like crazy, be the first to corner a specific market (nine cards of the same suit), and ring the closing bell. Sounds pretty realistic, doesn't it? Once you've got the basic game mastered, try throwing Bull and Bear cards into the mix--that's when things get really interesting!Pit comes neatly boxed with a set of durable game cards, instructions, and a heavy-duty metal bell that's great for slamming. There are rules included for a silent bidding version of the game, but jumping up and down, gesticulating wildly, and shouting yourself hoarse is half the fun.--George Laney ;
