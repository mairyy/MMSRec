Title: Educational Insights Mathshark ; Description: Educational Insights brings a terrific idea to life in Math Shark, a combination skill-building tool and calculator. The shape, colors, flashing lights, and beeps--all reminiscent of a hand-held electronic game--will appeal to kids who may not otherwise be interested in practicing math. (Parents: the sound is unobtrusive, but can be turned off.) Math Shark offers eight different skill levels and seven skill groupings: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, decimals, fractions, and percentages. After every question a red or green flashing light and a corresponding beep let you know whether or not you answered correctly. If you get one wrong, the right answer flashes, and the question keeps appearing, along with any others answered incorrectly, until you get it right. After each set an encouraging comment--"You did it!" or "Way to go!"--comes up on the screen. The sets are timed, and your score, based on how long it took to answer all the questions correctly, appears at the end. When practice is done for the day, Math Shark becomes a handy calculator. Requires two AA batteries, not included.--Rachel Radway ;
