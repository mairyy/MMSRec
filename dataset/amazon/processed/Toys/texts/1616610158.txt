These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience.

All together, the thirty-two included figures, over 300 cards, over 200 tokens and markers and nearly 70 puzzle tiles,will help immerse you in a sanity-bending story of terrifying mystery.
