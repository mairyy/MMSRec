Title: Little Tikes 8-in-1 Adjustable Playground (Colors May Vary) ; Description: Over 10 feet long from end to end--with portholes, doors,  ladders, slides, nooks, and crannies galore--this molded-plastic  playground promises years, if not decades, of entertainment before all  of its possibilities can be exhausted. A 2-foot-long climb-through  tunnel connects two separate, open-topped towers (one is 4.5 feet tall,  the other 5.5). The shorter tower has a swinging door and windows, the  larger one has two separate levels and two smooth-plastic slides (one is 3  feet long, the other 4). It's the perfect investment for bigger and  smaller kids to play with together. But best of all, the playground can  be disassembled and rebuilt into eight different configurations  whenever the current setup loses its charm. With Little Tikes' typical  rock-solid, kid-friendly construction, you can bet this sturdy  playground will be around long enough for that to happen.--Paul Hughes ;
