Title: Bratz Babyz Cloe ; Description: Some kids are just born with a sense of fashion and that&#x92;s the case with the Bratz Babyz. There&#x92;ll be no lace-trimmed diaper covers or sweet little ruffled dresses for these babies. Like their teen counterparts, these baby dolls have "a passion for fashion" and display their "brattitude" with hipster clothing that shows they are well on their way to becoming savvy dressers. Baby Cloe wears a turquoise and green tee and bottoms emblazoned with her icon Angel the pig. Her soon-to-be long blonde hair is already starting to grow and is pulled up into two removable sprout-like ponytails, which show off her stud earrings. Cloe wears her bottle around her neck on a stylish chain and comes with several other accessories including an pink blankie, a flashy hot pink diaper bag, and a pig stuffed animal. Cloe arrives in a package with a cool diaper pin handle.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
