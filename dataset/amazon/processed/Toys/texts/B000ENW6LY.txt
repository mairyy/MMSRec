Title: Hasbro Playskool Air-Powered Action Stadium ; Description: The Electronic Air-Powered Action Stadium is a really fun game that even parents will get into. It is, essentially, two games on one board: air hockey and pinball. Pinball purists might be disappointed since there's no ball, but rather a puck, and there's no plunger. There are no bumpers, either, but you can invert the air hockey paddles and use them as bumper-like stationary objects in the table. Assembly of the table takes about ten minutes, though it does require adult-level reading and force to snap the plastic pieces together. Once it's fully assembled, it feels as solid as one piece and there are no noticeable dead zones to keep the puck from floating. Overall, the design of this game is ingenious. The table converts from pinball to air hockey in a second, which levels the table, locks the paddles, and opens the player-two goal. Sensors built into the table keep track of your score, but there is no display of the ongoing tally. The game enthusiastically announces both the winner and scores at the end of each match and says things during the game like, "These players are really great!" On the downside, there's no off button and no volume control, which is unfortunate for a toy that features cute but somewhat loud retro video game sounds and an enthusiastic announcer. After about a minute, it will ask, "Player, are you still there?" before shutting itself down. Also, the scoring during pinball gets easily confused. The high-score modes are based on a time limit, but you can keep adding to the score between the buzzer and when the score is announced. Still, it's a simple and ultra fun toy for one or two players.--Porter B. Hall ;
