Title: Candy Land - Dora The Explorer ; Description: What could be better than a candy-themed fiesta with Dora, Diego, and Boots? Candyland, that venerable early-childhood board game gets spiced up with the cute characters of Nick Jr.'s Dora the Explorer cartoon show. Kids need not know how to read to enjoy the game because counting and color recognition guides them along this sweet path. Best of all, the game provides a learning opportunity for young readers since the game board has several objects and characters identified in both English and Spanish. The first player to make it to the fiesta at the end wins. Includes the game board, deck of game cards, English and Spanish instructions, and four character pawns: Dora, Diego, Boots, and Map/Backpack.--Porter B. Hall ;
