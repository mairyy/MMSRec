Title: Playhut Crawl N Play ; Description: This lightweight, sturdy, flame-resistant nylon play structure  can be set up in 30 seconds. There are no poles to piece together and  insert (or lose or break). The Crawl N Play pops open and keeps its  shape, thanks to the sewn-in spring-action frame. Indoors or out, the  three modular units--one 32-by-33-by-33-inch block with four round  openings and a roof window, plus two tunnels, each 18 inches across and  20 inches long--fit together with hook-and-loop tabs. Kids can create a  clubhouse, a castle, a dungeon, a tower, a jail, a rabbit burrow, a  bear's den, a pirate ship, an outlaw hideout, Aladdin's cave, a  house on the prairie--whatever a game of make-believe seems to demand.  The structure folds up to fit in the included nylon carry case, and it  can be connected to other Crawl N Play modular sets to form larger  structures.--Ava Natov ;
