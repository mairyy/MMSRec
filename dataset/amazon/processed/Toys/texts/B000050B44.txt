Title: Spalding NBA Youth Outdoor Basketball - Youth Size 5 (27.5&quot;) ; Description: This youth basketball is endorsed by the NBA, so you know it has to be  good--it's even signed by NBA Commissioner David Stern. We found it to have  superlative grip and just the right amount of bounce for outdoor action. This  premium Spalding ball has a durable rubber cover that is designed to last  through all the dribbling, lay-ups, and slam dunks you can dish out. The size 5  (27.5 inches) basketball is ideal for players ages 5 to 8.--M. Sullivan ;
