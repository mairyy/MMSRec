Title: Reclining 4 Stage Feeding Seat ; Description: This feeding seat is as revolutionary and useful for households as the bunk bed, computer, or vacuum cleaner. It has eight adjustable positions that "grow" with babies, from infant to older toddler stages (up to 50 pounds). The high-backed chair reclines to three positions, whether for eating, napping, or play. The comfort-contoured chair includes a 3-point safety belt, wide base, and passive leg restraint. The wide, two-sided tray is dishwasher-safe with height levels for smaller or larger babies. It also features a spill-proof cup and several tray compartments for a diversity of food or toys.Diane Beall ;
