Title: Moby Clutching Toy ; Description: Elegant, rainbow-colored Moby is a beautiful toy that seems designed as much for parents as for  babies. Made of smooth, well-turned wood, Moby is a fish of a different color: his body is made of a series  of rainbow discs, tightly held together by a string of elastic. When manipulated, his little body wriggles this  way and that, clacking and clicking in a satisfying manner. On the front end is a cute smiling face; on the  rear, a green tail suitable for teething on.--Claire Dederer ;
