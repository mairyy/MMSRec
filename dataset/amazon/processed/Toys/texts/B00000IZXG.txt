Title: Cathedral Classic ; Description: Just as it is in a modern metropolis, space is at a premium in the game of Cathedral. This game  is a developer's dream! Cathedral challenges two players to place as many buildings as possible within the  walls of a medieval city. There are two sets (light and dark) of hardwood buildings of various sizes. To  begin the game, one player places the cathedral on the grid of the walled city. Then the two players vie for  the remaining land. Their goal is to place their own buildings while thwarting their opponent's  land-grabbing tendencies. If a player can completely surround one of his/her opponent's buildings, that  building is removed from the board and the space gobbled up by a different building. The game ends up  resembling a puzzle that must be thoughtfully pieced together. The winner is the player whose unplaced  buildings would occupy the least amount of space in the city. Fans of chess should enjoy exercising their  strategizing muscles on this one. The hardwood board measures 9.25 inches square.--Wendy  Slotboom ;
