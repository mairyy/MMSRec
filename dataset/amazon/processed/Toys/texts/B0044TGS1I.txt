Title: Prism Stowaway Delta Kite ; Description: Enjoy the high-tech look of a sport kite without the complication and learning curve. The new Stowaway Delta puts a classic, high flying single-liner in a package that'll fit in a briefcase to take anywhere. The tough fiberglass frame makes flying a breeze in a wide wind range, and the high flying angle allows maximum altitude. Bungees in the spars make assembly a snap - just let the rods spring into their connectors like a tent pole. For added flair, optional tails attach at wingtips and spine. The 5-foot wing folds to just 18" long, and the great-looking package includes kite and 200' of premium braided Dacron line on a hoop winder. Fun, stable and easy to fly for all ages. ;
