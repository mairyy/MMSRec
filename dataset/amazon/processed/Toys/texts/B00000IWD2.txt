Title: Monopoly Junior Party (EA) ; Description: Just like its big brother, Monopoly Jr. is big-time fun for everyone! Spend a day at the amusement park. Ride the roller coaster, bumper cars, or Ferris wheel. How about a game of miniature golf or a visit to the haunted house? It's simple--set up ticket booths on as many boardwalk amusements as possible, then build your fortune collecting the entrance fees as other players land on your properties. If someone else already owns an amusement, you pay up. Watch out--if one player owns both amusements of the same color, you must pay them double! So have some fun. And don't forget--pass GO, collect $2.--Alison Golder ;
