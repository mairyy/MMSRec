Title: iMAgiNiff Game ; Description: That iMAgiNiff was developed by two brothers (in Australia) makes perfect sense, because this is a board game you'll want to share with family and friends. It's simple to play. A set of names is chosen, usually the name of every player plus those of several absent friends. When it's your turn, one name is selected as the subject of the question. You pick a card--one of hundreds--that poses a question and six possible answers (for example, "Imaginiff _____ were a crime. Which would he/she be?"). Read the question aloud, plugging in the subject's name. Then read out the six answers (in this case, they range from "homicide" to "indecent exposure"). Each player picks an answer to fit the subject; those who have picked the most popular answer move forward. But though you win by advancing, winning is obviously not the point: laughter and arguments are. The questions on the cards range from the ridiculous ("Imaginiff _____ were a body part.") to the provocative ("Imaginiff _____ had to decide which of the following values is most important."). The game is a fun cross between Scruples and True Colors.--Elisa Murray ;
