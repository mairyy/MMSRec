Title: Playskool Musical Activity Ball and Gear Center ; Description: Whirling, twirling, musical fun is on the way with this exciting MUSICAL GEAR CENTER set! Your little one can push this button to activate the music and motion that will keep both his eyes and ears engaged. As he drops the ball onto the track, he'll watch with delight as it falls down the tube and then spins at the bottom. He'll love spinning the gears on the side to turn the friendly face around and around--and when he gets older, you can remove the gears so he can stack them and take his fun to "new heights"! The active play, twirling fun and happy music just goes on and on! ;
