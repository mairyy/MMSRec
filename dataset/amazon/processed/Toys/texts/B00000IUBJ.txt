Title: Tolo Toys Musical Jack in the Box ; Description: This 5-inch-square musical jack-in-the-box--in bright blue, red, yellow, and green--packs a lot of surprises. Hold the easy-grip handle, wind the crank (the round knob makes it easy for little fingers to grab), and it plays "This Old Man." A smiling clown pops up at unpredictable intervals and can be pushed back down easily. As if that weren't entertainment enough, there's a yellow button on one side of the box that squeaks when you push it and a yellow star on the other side that clicks when you turn it. Turn the whole toy upside down so your little tyke can find her own smiling face in the safety mirror. Made of plastic; easy to clean.--Elisabeth Fredrickson ;
