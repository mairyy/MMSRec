Title: Munchkin Zombies ; Description: Braaiiinns. It&#x2019;s the sickest, silliest Munchkin yet. The players are zombies, kicking down doors and eating brains. The &#x201C;monsters&#x201D; they&#x2019;re attacking are people, some helpless and some hazardous, with a few rogue zombies thrown in. The armor is whatever they&#x2019;ve blundered across during their lurching search for brains. So bravely the munchkins go forth, with mousetraps on their feet and a bowling trophy protecting their poor rotting heads to level up, or to die. Again. ;
