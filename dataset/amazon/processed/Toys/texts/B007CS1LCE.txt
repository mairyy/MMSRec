A visual dictionary linked to words on each page provides vocabulary expansion opportunities, and games involving the arrangement of words and sentence structure promote reading comprehension.A Custom Fit for Your ChildUltra eBooks allow children to engage with the story in multiple modes. In Read to Me mode, children hear the entire text read aloud for a non-stop storytelling experience. In Read with Me mode, the story is read with pauses on each page for the play/learn activities. In Read on My Own mode, children read the text on their own and can even record and replay their own voice for each page. As children complete word-based and comprehension-based activities, their scores help suggest a text level that will provide the appropriate level of challenge. Different story levels introduce increasingly complex spelling patterns along with high-frequency sight words. At any point, children may choose to engage with text that is above their recommended level, which allows exposure (with audio support) to even richer language and more sophisticated sentence structures while promoting listening comprehension.Innovative Learning ApproachLeapFrog learning games, apps and eBooks are designed by our in-house educational experts and grounded in the latest research for the richest possible learning experience. Promoting learning through play taps into children&#x2019;s natural curiosity and inspires them to explore. While reading, children may touch on individual words to hear them pronounced and sounded out. In addition, they can build vocabulary knowledge by touching on illustrations or tapping on a word to access an audio-visual definition in the interactive visual dictionary.What's In The Box?LeapFrog&#x2019;s Disney&#x2022;Pixar Cars 2 Ultra eBook Explorer game cartridge (compatible with LeapFrog LeapPad1 and LeapPad2 Learning Tablets sold separately) and Parents Guide.Take advantage of hundreds of game cartridges and downloads that keep kids challenged and inspired.
