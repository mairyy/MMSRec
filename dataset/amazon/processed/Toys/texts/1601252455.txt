Title: Kill Doctor Lucky Game ; Description: The Origins award winning board game from James Ernest and Cheapass games comes to your gaming table in a new full-color, high-quality deluxe edition featuring components on par with the best European board games. Kill Doctor Lucky pits 3 to 7 players against each other in a race to see who can kill Doctor Lucky. The trick is that all the other players want to do it first and will stop at nothing to prevent you from having the pleasure. And the old doctor has earned his nickname well: he's got more lives than Rasputin and an uncanny knack for dodging your best traps. But his luck can't last forever. Before the game is over, someone is going to kill Doctor Lucky-wouldn't you rather it were you? Everyone starts in the drawing room, and everyone wants to kill Doctor Lucky. Players move around the mansion looking for weapons and trying to catch the old man alone. Trying to kill the Doctor is pretty easy, but every other player can play failure cards to stop you. Doctor Lucky's luck runs out eventually, though, and you just hope you can catch him when it does. This new edition now includes the "And His Little Dog Too" expansion-3 rules variants that feature Doctor Lucky's dog, Shamrock. He's just as lucky as his master and has an annoying habit of making you feel fond of him.  Kill Doctor Lucky includes: a full-color game board, a deck of 96 full-color cards, full-color rule book, 30 spite tokens, pawns and stands for seven players, Doctor Lucky, and his dog ;
