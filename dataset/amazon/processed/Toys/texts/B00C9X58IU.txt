Title: LEGO Creator 31011 Aviation Adventure ; Description: Perform the coolest, most daring aerial maneuvers with the Aviation Adventures set. Move the tail wheel of this highly detailed propeller plane back and forth to prime the 8-cylinder radial engine and watch the propeller spin. Open the engine cover to access the gear assembly. Set the propeller pitch, slide open the hinged canopy and hop in the detailed cockpit with space for 2 minifigures. Check the flaps and instruments, then thunder down the runway and soar into the air as you raise the undercarriage for flight mode. Rebuild into a modern helicopter with detailed cockpit instruments or a sleek speedboat with opening canopy function and luggage compartment using the supplied alternate building instructions. ;
