Title: Hot Wheels Turbo Driver Controller ; Description: The HotWheels.com XR Player is an online game controller that gives boys access to "Race the World", an exclusive 3D racing game, and also works with more than 20 cool games hosted on HotWheels.com. The player works with 8 different Car-Tridges (one comes with the controller, 7 are sold separately). Each Car-Tridge, when loaded into the controller, shows up on screen and enables a boy to race with all the attributes of that exact car. Each car works best in one of 8 environments in the 3D game, so choose the best Car-Tridge and conquer each level of the game to become the ultimate Xtreme Racer. ;
