Title: Transformers  Voyager Longhaul ; Description: LONG HAUL is too bitter to be an effective soldier on his own. Despite the fact that he is part of one of the most destructive and terrifying DECEPTICON squads of all time, he is too often treated as little more than a cargo hauler. Other DECEPTICONS sling their gear into his bed without a second thought, and order him to carry it around for them. Rather than confront them, he&#x2019;d rather grumble about it privately, then stop on the way and destroy whatever he&#x2019;s been given responsibility for.    Recreate exciting movie scenes or stage your own living room battles with this awesome DECEPTICON defender!  Featuring MECH ALIVE gearing, this mighty robot figure has moving pistons and snap-out swords! Convert to vehicle mode to reveal a dump truck with working bed!  No matter what AUTOBOT enemy is waiting for him, this super-cool vehicle is ready to dump the competition! ;
