Title: Transformers  Bumblebee Figure ; Description: Having chosen to stay with Sam after the end of the battle for the AllSpark, BUMBLEBEE made arrangements to stay close to him at all times. It&#x2019;s been a pretty good deal. He gets regular detailing, and as much high-grade fuel as he needs. Plus, he gets to spend time with Sam and Mikaela. His vocal processors still aren&#x2019;t fully up to snuff, but he and his friends communicate just fine. If he ever misses the action of battle, he can always give IRONHIDE a call and go DECEPTICON hunting.     Get ready to roll out with this AUTOBOT ally! This detailed BUMBLEBEE figure unleashes a launching pulse missile in robot mode and converts to a cool, Camaro concept car in vehicle mode! The battle is on and this bright yellow warrior is ready &#x2013; are you? ;
