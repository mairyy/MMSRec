Title: Radio Flyer Liberty Spring Horse with Sound ; Description: This classic spring horse neighs, clip-clops, and has a real yarn mane and tail. Beautifully sculpted with great attention to details make this horse attractive and realistic. The sturdy steel frame is extra wide, so as to prevent tipping. Springs are covered with thick, removable fabric wraps to prevent finger pinching, and built in safety spring straps allow for extra security. ;
