Title: Pewi Ybike Ride On Toy and Walking Buddy ; Description: The Pewi provides a stable balance aid for early walking practice.The Ybike Pewi offers a sleek new take on the toddler walking/riding toy concept. Designed to help babies and young toddlers develop spatial awareness, balance, and gross motor skills, the Pewi provides both a "sit on" walker and a walking aid push toy. As soon as babies can pull up to stand and begin to take steps, the Pewi can be used as a stable push toy for walking practice. Thanks to the Pewi's wide and long base, the toy won't flip over when the child leans into it.Children large enough to sit on the seat with their feet on the floor can use the Pewi like a traditional walker. But, in contrast to traditional walkers, the Pewi requires children to find their own balance, developing trunk muscles and developing spatial awareness as they play. For bigger kids, the Pewi is a fun foot to floor ride-on with a maximum load capacity of 44 pounds. The multi direction caster wheels allow a child to ride and easily control the Pewi in any direction. With non marking rubber wheels, the Pewi will not damage or mark floors making it equally suitable for use for indoors or outdoors on smooth play surfaces. The Ybike Pewi's innovative design provides toddlers with versatile play options that grow with their bodies and with their developmental stages.Specifications:Recommended age range: 12 to 36 monthsMaximum child height: 43 inches / 110 centimetersMaximum weight capacity: 44 poundsFrame material: aluminumAssembled dimensions: 26 by 22 by 18 inches (LxWxH)Product weight: 4.4 pounds ;
