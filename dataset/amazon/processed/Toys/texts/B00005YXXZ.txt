Title: Operation: Brain Surgery Game ; Description: Sometimes you can't help but wonder about the original meeting where the idea for a toy was first introduced. Because in order to get Operation Brain Surgery produced, someone must have sat down in a room somewhere and explained that they were proposing a game based on brain surgery. And that they were serious. As strange as that meeting must surely have been, the game is actually a lot of fun in a bizarre kind of way. In fact, its very strangeness probably makes it even more fun. The patient (same big-nosed guy from the original Operation game) gives encouragement and ribbing to players throughout the game. The object is to remove objects such as a bird (for "bird brain"), train (for "train of thought"), and egg (for "egg head"). As in Operation, it takes a steady hand to avoid upsetting the patient and win the game.--John Moe ;
