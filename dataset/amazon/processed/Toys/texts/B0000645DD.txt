Title: Jakks Atari Classics 10 In 1 TV Games ; Description: Today&#x92;s video games with all their bells and whistles had to begin somewhere, and that somewhere was your living room, in, say, 1982.  Remember Asteroids, Missile Command, and Breakout? How about Centipede, Adventure and Gravitar? This TV Games Video System--just a "smart" joystick and nothing else--delivers 10 classic games in all. The joystick has the typical up-down-left-right movements, and single functions to select, start, and reset games. Front-and-center is a big, red fire button ("fire" being the only way to propel or kill things back then). The unit hooks up to your TV via those yellow and white AV output jacks (which should already be on your TV or VCR), and requires 4 "AA" batteries.--Diane Beall ;
