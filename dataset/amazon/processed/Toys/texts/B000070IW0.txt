Title: Fisher-Price Learning Patterns Rocker ; Description: The only thing a parent values more than an item that makes kids happy is an item that&#x92;s going to keep them happy for a long time. Fortunately, some items are up to that daunting challenge: LEGOs, Harry Potter, and this very cool rocker that&#x92;s designed to grow with kids from infants all the way up to 40 pound toddlers. For infants, it reclines, features a toy bar of dangly stuffed friends, and it vibrates. Like a good long car trip, a vibrating seat is bound to calm baby and possibly send him off to dreamland. As baby grows, the toy bar can be removed and the toys clipped on to the side. And as baby turns into kid, the backrest can be raised making the chair more of a regular rocker. We loved the versatility of this chair as well as the festive blue pattern.--John Moe ;
