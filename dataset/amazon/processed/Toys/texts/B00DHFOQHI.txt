Title: Ubooly Smart Toy - Pink ; Description: When I was a kid I used to talk to my stuffed animals. They almost never talked back but that didnt stop me from having some pretty memorable conversations. As a grown up kid, I was a bit disappointed when I realized that talking stuffed animals still arent a thing. Why dont kids toys make better use of today's amazing technology? What's worse is the toys that do tend to turn kids into the worlds cutest zombies making kids stare at a screen and mindlessly tap buttons. Kids need mental AND physical stimulation. A truly good toy should harness technology and encourage kids to explore, use their imagination and be curious. You know, normal kid stuff. ;
