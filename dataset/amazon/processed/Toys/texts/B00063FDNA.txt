Title: Fisher-Price&reg; Imaginext Razor the T-Rex ; Description: Dinosaurs are a common obsession among kids and this dinosaur toy takes children back to the Mesozoic Era for unlimited play in a prehistoric time. Razor, a replica of a Tyrannosaurus Rex, has razor-sharp teeth and, when kids pull the lever under his tail, he bites with them and emits a startling roar. In addition to a moving jaw, this T-Rex moves vertically at the neck, arms, legs, and tail. Per Fisher-Price&#x92;s storyline for these beasts, kids can pretend that Razor is the head of the Predators, a group of dinosaurs destroying all the natural resources. Or kids can challenge their imagination by creating their own stories and scenes with this fierce warrior. Razor comes with a saddle on his back, a catapult, a scorpion, and dinosaur bones. Also included is a caveman figure, which, although not exactly accurate for the time period, extends play possibilities a bit. Three "AAA" batteries are included to power the sound effects.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
