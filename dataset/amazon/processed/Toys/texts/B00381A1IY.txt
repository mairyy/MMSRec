Title: Chuggington StackTrack Wilson ; Description: Wilson is a lively multi-function engine with oodles of enthusiasm and confidence. His eagerness isn't always matched by his ability to pay attention, so he has some learning to do about listening and following instructions. He's a bit of a scatterbrain and as such often finds himself in deep water. Wilson sometimes gets frustrated at something new or unfamiliar, but he's always curious and ready to learn. His catchphrases include "It's training time" and "Let's ride the rails!"   Enjoy the action-packed train play with Chuggington Die-Cast!
