Title: V.Smile Interactive Learning Handheld Game ; Description: This hand held version of the popular V Smile educational game console makes for a handy companion on a trip, in the backyard, or wherever a kid might want to go. It works with all the same V Smile "smartridges" as the larger console and features adaptable buttons for left and right handed play. Back at home, it can also plug into a television set to play all the games on a bigger screen. The appeal of the V Smile series, of course, is that all the games are educational and help build skills that kids don&#x92;t even realize they&#x92;re building. This pocket size set includes a game of Zayzoo, My Alien Classmate that teaches vocabulary, math, logic, and more.--Charlie Williams ;
