Title: My Little Pony Celebration Castle with Baby Pony Pink Sunsparkle and Romperooni ; Description: "Sunsparkle" Pony's Celebration Castle requires basic construction, but putting it together with a grownup will be a fun adventure, as Pony lovers see the charming structure taking form. Once finished, "Sunsparkle" (an included and somewhat rare Pony) can happily trot around her master bedroom, vanity room, disco, kitchen, and a bathroom. Each room features furnishings or appliances that have clever innovations, such as a stove that doubles as a kitchen sink. There's also a working elevator, full-length mirror, hot air balloon, two balconies, tableware, Pony clothing, and a brush for "Sunsparkle's" mane. As a gift, a sparkling pink, child-sized crown is included. To top it all off, the castle features charming music and flashing lights on the disco dance floor! Required: 3, 1.5-volt "AA" batteries.Diane Beall ;
