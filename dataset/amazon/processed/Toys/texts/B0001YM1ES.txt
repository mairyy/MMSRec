Title: GeoTrax Rail &amp; Road System - Mile High Mountain ; Description: The starting point for this Fisher-Price train-track set for toddlers is a mountaintop chalet surrounded by lush, green pine trees. Tugging a crate of goods, the blue loader-engine train departs the chalet, winds down the track, kept securely on by a yellow guard rail, and whizzes through an underground tunnel. It's a relatively one-dimensional toy, though the layout can be rearranged to connect to other GeoTrax sets.--Andy Boynton ;
