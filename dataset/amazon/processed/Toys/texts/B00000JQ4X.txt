He is amazingly lifelike, from the "real" dog nose button to the huge dark eyes that you'll stare at to see if they blink. Made from soft brown material from the tips of his perky ears to the tip of his little tail, Tiny can sit in the palm of your hand. The perfect dog, he can go everywhere you go but never needs food or water. Everyone will love Tiny--he's perfect as a toy or for your collection. Surface wash only.--Peggy Etra ;
