Title: Chuggington Interactive Railway - Wash and Fuel Set ; Description: The Chuggington Interactive Railway brings your favorite engines to life via SmartTalk technology! Each "smart" engine actually recognizes and reacts with other Chuggington Interactive engines and with key Chuggington Interactive train stops! Brewster is a strong and solid diesel-electric train built for heavy loads. He doesn't always understand his own strength, which can make him a bit awkward and clumsy. Take him through the Chug Wash and hear him react as to the different wash cycles. Then, head over to the Fuel Depot where he can fill up. Also includes an overhead signal and figure 8 layout. ;
