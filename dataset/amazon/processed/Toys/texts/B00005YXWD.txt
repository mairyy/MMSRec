Title: Lite-Brite Cube ; Description: Lite Brite offers a whole new dimension to creative play with the latest rendition: the Lite Brite Cube. While the space to create on is a bit smaller, artists now have four pegged panels into which they can poke colors. The cube requires adult assembly, but once that&#x92;s done, it&#x92;s just like you remember. Choose a design sheet from the eight included--or go freeform with solid black paper--and start plugging colored pegs into their respective spots. Over 500 pegs are included in a rainbow of colors, and the cube has two drawers to store them in. (These drawers fall out quite easily and can cause a mess of spilled pegs, so be careful when transporting.) New to the peg world are Power Pegs--up to four of the same colored peg molded together for quicker completion. The Lite Brite Cube has a blue plastic handle at the top so artwork can be carried around (and shown off) easily.--Pam Lauer ;
