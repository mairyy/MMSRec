Title: Monster High Freaky Fusion Bonita Femur Doll ; Description: Monster High has an entirely new class of monsters - hybrids! These ghouls are the frightful children of two completely different, completely creepy cool creatures! Meet Bonita Femur, who's part Skeleton and part Moth but 100 percent monster! She tends to chew on her clothes when she's nervous - a real shame for such a "fusionista"! Her black dress is high-in-the-sky fashion with a moth-inspired print, shredded skirt and pink netting on the skirt overlay and shoulders. Bright yellow booties and a matching moth-adorned belt are killer touches, but her wings are truly frightful! With ombre shading from pink to black, the elaborately decorated boning extends from head to toe for a boo-tiful effect. Plus, unique articulation lets this enchanting monster stand on her own. Use the Skullette hairbrush to keep her gore-geous long platinum blonde hair in spooktacular style. Ghouls will love creating stories for this two-in-one character. Doll also comes with a diary and hairbrush. Ages 6 and older. ;
