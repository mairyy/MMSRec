Title: LeapFrog Discovery Ball ; Description: Little ones have a ball as they spin, bat, roll and learn. Babies press any letter on the ball to hear the letter name, letter sound or one of 26 classic tunes. Then they spin or roll the ball to hear the "ABC" song, or one of three other melodies, while twinkling lights flash to the beat. The music stops when the ball stops, encouraging your little one to spin or roll again and again. Infants spin the Discovery Ball in its base; toddlers detach the ball for roll-around fun. What it Teaches: * Letter names  * Letter sounds  * Musical awareness  * Motor skills ;
