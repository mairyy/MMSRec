Title: Beyblade Metal Fury Performance Top System Legendary Bladers Set ; Description: It&#x2019;s a pack of attack, defense and stamina with the Legendary Bladers 3-pack set of spinning battle tops. In the attack column of this trio of fierce Beyblade tops is the Cosmic Pegasus W105R2F top, with a Spin Track part whose wings push down to help stabilize its spinning attacks. Its Right Rubber Flat Performance Tip part gives it increased gripping power. How will it stand up against your Fang Leone 130W2D Defense top and its Wave Wide Defense Performance Tip part for endurance? Will your Phantom Orion 145ES Stamina top endure against either with its Eternal Spike Performance Tip that helps maximize stamina? Create custom top combinations by switching parts, and may the best top win. ;
