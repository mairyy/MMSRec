Title: ALEX&reg; Toys - Bathtime Fun Water Drums 4010 ; Description: Bump ba-da-bump bump! Splash-splash! Parents who are convinced their thumping, bumping, smashing children are destined to be drummers, now&#x92;s your chance to get them (drum) rolling down that career path. This excellent toy encourages budding musicians to explore principles of rhythm even while they get squeaky-clean. Two drums float in the bath (or wading pool, sink, bucket&#x85;). Players beat on the drums with the drumsticks (two included), changing pitch by adjusting the water height of the drums. A clever, waterproof rhythm chart uses pictures of hands to guide drummers in learning five different rhythm patterns. Of course, improvisation is always a great way to learn, too, and kids&#x92; musical imagination will be sparked the moment they lay eyes on these drums. (Ages 3 years and older)--Emilie Coulter ;
