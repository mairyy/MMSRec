The included book,Ozzie and Mack, features the rhyming adventures of Ozzie Otter and his playful animal friends. Text for this book is preloaded onto the Tag reader, so as soon as you load two AAA batteries (not included) into the reader, the story can begin.A little camera in the tip of the reader identifies words and symbols on the specially printed pages, giving kids lots of options. They can pick between starting a story at the beginning and having it read all the way through, playing a page at a time, or reading themselves and using the Tag reader to hear single, tricky words spoken aloud. This last option inspires kids to try reading books they might otherwise avoid, since the Tag reader is always there to help them out.Young readers are sure to enjoy the way character voices add drama to their favorite stories, the way touching certain pictures inspires quirky sound effects, and the leveled activities included in LeapFrog books.Explore the World of ReadingLeapFrog presents a library of books that are compatible with the Tag reader. Classics likeThe Little Engine That Couldcome to life, and kids' favorite characters, such as SpongeBob SquarePants and Kung Fu Panda, help them connect with new stories. LeapFrog has even teamed with National Geographic Kids to present activity cards featuring different animals that the Tag reader brings to life.To use additional books and games, you'll need to install the LeapFrog connect application on your computer. Once this is done, it becomes easy to download audio for the books you have and put them on your Tag reader. Use the included USB cable to connect the reader to your computer, and drag-and-drop up to five stories onto it.Watch Children Fall in Love With BooksYoung readers may be too busy following the escapades of their new friends to realize they are building phonics skills, expanding their vocabulary, and improving their reading comprehension. The Learning Path can help you keep up with their progress.

While the reader seemed quite durable, the imaginative world of stories that it opens up is a gift that will long outlast the reader itself.Although headphones are not included, the Tag reader is compatible with most headphones, so kids can concentrate on reading without being distracted or disrupting others.What's in the BoxTag Reader, USB cable, LeapFrog Connect software CD, and the bookOzzie and Mack. ;
