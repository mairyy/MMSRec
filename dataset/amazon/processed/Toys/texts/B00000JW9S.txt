Title: ThinkFun Rush Hour 2 ; Description: Fasten your safety belt: Binary Arts presents a card pack full of  40 new challenges for fans of their fast-pacedRush Hour traffic  jam puzzle. In the original game, the player's goal was to  maneuver a set of cars and trucks, restricted by the 6-inch-square  playing grid, out of various traffic jam scenarios. The Rush Hour  2 deck provides all-new gridlock situations with equal numbers of  intermediate, advanced, expert, and grand master challenges.  "Intermediate" jams require 10 to 20 moves, but "expert" messes can  take over 50. Each puzzle's solution is printed on the back of its setup  card, making it handy for those who truly feel stuck. And just for fun, a  new candy-apple-red convertible accompanies the deck. Note: you  must already own the Rush Hour puzzle to use this pack.--Liane Thomas ;
