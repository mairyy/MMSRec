Title: Bratz Rock Angelz Doll - Yasmin ; Description: In this series of Bratz dolls, the girls still have "a passion for fashion" but develop a hard rock edge to their trendy ensembles. A member of the all-girl band Rock Angelz, Yasmin is ready to take the mic and play some ground-shaking guitar riffs in her rocker girl getup. The doll wears a Rock Angelz concert tee, a black leather jacket, sparkly bell-bottom jeans, and black heels. Yasmin seals her punk persona with a tattooed and pierced bellybutton, sparkly eye shadow, and funky streaked highlights in her hair. An alternate outfit consisting of a glittery mini-skirt and t-shirt gives Yasmin a change of clothes for multiple nights of performing. In addition to a guitar and microphone with stand, Yasmin&#x92;s accessories include a hairbrush, jewelry, lipstick, a cell phone, sunglasses, and a doll stand. As a bonus, this doll comes with an exclusive band poster and a mini CD that plays two songs and features a preview of the Bratz Rock Angelz video game. These dolls are three-time winners of the People&#x92;s Choice Toy of the Year award.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
