Title: Jacquard Tie Dye Kit ; Description: A great introduction to fabric dyeing and textile handling, this kit is sure to make a  dyed-in-the-wool fan out of anyone who uses it. Professional-quality fiber-reactive dyes are combined with excellent  illustrated instructions to ensure excellent results, even for total beginners. The set contains red, yellow, and  blue dyes; a mixing bottle; latex gloves; and rubber bands. This is a great party kit--just add teenagers,  T-shirts, and adult supervision. Dyes are not nontoxic; these are the actual dyes that craftspeople use. This kit  will dye between 10 and 15 shirts.--S. J. Kurtz ;
