Title: Kick N learn Piano ; Description: Parents who responded to piano lessons by kicking the instrument may  appreciate this toy as much as a baby will. Two ties hang it from the side of  the crib, five "keys" on the soft cover conceal five buttons, and colored shapes  above each "key" light up when they are hit or kicked. In one mode, the five  "keys" play individually, like piano keys; in another, they play a medley of 10  tunes; in a third, they sound out animal names, numbers, and other concepts that  are keyed to the pattern on the cover. The Kick 'n' Learn Piano includes an  on/off switch, auto off, and high/low volume control. Requires three AA  batteries.--Richard Farr ;
