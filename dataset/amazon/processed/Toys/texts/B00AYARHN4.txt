Title: Melissa &amp; Doug Sunny Patch Sand Brick Maker and Trowel Set ; Description: Fill the mold with sand, level it off with the trowel, and create sand bricks in the sandbox or at the beach. Kids will love setting up their very own brick-making workshop or building site with molded plastic tools sized just for them. The colorful, easy-to-grasp pieces, designed to look like Taffy Sea Turtle and Clicker Crab, make it simple to create a whole row of bricks to make a mini sea wall. When the building is done, this two-piece set rinses clean and snaps together for convenient storage. ;
