Title: Fisher Price Rock &amp; Play Piano ; Description: Here's another great item in the Sparkling Symphony line of toys by Fisher-Price. Younger ones can create music with the Rock and Play Piano by sitting on the included seat and rocking, while older toddlers can play it like a real piano using three different modes. In mode one, simply press a key to hear an entire song. In mode two, press a key to hear part of a song and press another key to hear more. In mode three, play your own song by tapping the keys--an instrument selector allows players to choose the piano, violin, harp, tuba, or flute. The piano offers a repertoire of four classical songs and four children's tunes. Stimulate kids' senses and activate their imaginations with this enjoyable addition to Fisher-Price's family of musical toys.--Jane Snyder ;
