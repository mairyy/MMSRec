Title: Dip Stix Giant Bubble Grab &amp; Go Kit (TM) now manufactured in USA! ; Description: Dip Stix Grab and Go Kits contain everything you need to make huge bubbles including one big bubble wand, one portable Ziploc container to hold your solution and one four ounce bottle of Dip Stix Giant Bubble Mix. The secret is in the formula. Dip Stix Kits make it easy and convenient to create huge, colorful, long lasting bubbles. Add one four ounce bottle of mix to one quart of tap water, mix and remove foam. Dip Stix mix works great right away and works even better when left to age overnight. The formula is so robust oftentimes bubbles will sit on the ground without bursting. Check out the picture of the Dip Stix bubble on the ground. If you look closely you can see blades of grass sticking through the wall of the big bubble, yet it didn't burst. You can't do that with homemade formula. Manufacturer's Note: We guarantee we'll send you the wand, solution, and specially designed carrying pouch. Extreme Bubbles, Inc. is the only source on Amazon offering the original Dip Stix Giant Bubble Grab & Go Kit. You can tell an original, made in the USA, Dip Stix Kit by the red and yellow handles, and the super absorbent cotton wick. Final Note: Proper mixing directions are to add one bottle of Dip Stix Mix to 4 cups of water. There are some directions that say to add mix to 14 cups of tap water. This is not correct. Add mix to one quart of water, or 4 cups. ;
