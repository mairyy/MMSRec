Title: Radio Flyer Interactive Riding Horse ; Description: Meet Blaze, the next best thing to a real horse. This beautiful, realistically designed spring horse responds to your child's motion with lifelike sounds triggered by three levels of riding action: walking, trotting and galloping. The spring horse also encourages imaginative play: the horse responds with eating sounds when "fed" the carrot accessory, and the soft yarn mane can be brushed with the comb accessory. For maximum safety, Blaze has an innovative "X" frame base with EZ Climb step for easy on/off. ;
