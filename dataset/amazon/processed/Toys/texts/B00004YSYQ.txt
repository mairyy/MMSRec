Title: Child's Hoover Upright Vacuum ; Description: Often the best way to get the housework done is to have your children working by your side.  When it's time to vacuum, preschoolers can use this toy Hoover right alongside an adult using a real  vacuum cleaner. Sized for preschoolers, the navy and black, hard plastic vacuum stands 26.25 inches high  and has adjustable levers in front, working lights, and a realistic motor sound. There's a flexible black hose  on one side and three yellow plastic attachments inside a storage compartment with a clear door. Though  the Hoover is fairly sturdy, the door isn't the most durable part of it; after a while it may begin to fall open,  making the attachments fall on the floor. There's also a removable cloth dust bag inside, although the  suction action is so slight that very little dirt is actually collected. Four C batteries are required (not  included).--Marcie Bovetz ;
