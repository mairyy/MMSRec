Title: Tan vs Green TimMee Plastic Army Men: 100 Piece Set of 2 inch Toy Soldier Figures - Made in the USA ! ; Description: An American Classic is back! This bag of 100 Tim Mee 'plastic army guys' is proudly manufactured in the United States, and includes 50 tan and 50 green troops for maximum play value. There's about 12 different figures and all your old favorites are here, including minesweeper, bazookaman, radio operator, 60mm mortar, light machine gunner, kneeling rifleman, flame thrower, crawling rifleman, prone rifleman, bayonet fighter, and officer with binoculars and handgun. Figures stand up to 2.1 inches tall (52mm) and are approximately 1:35 scale. Made from fairly stiff HDPE plastic with medium detail, a little flashing and those typically thin Tim Mee heads. Originally produced by Tim Mee around 1968, these figures may have been the first to depict US infantry troops during the Cold War with contemporary equipment including M16 A1 rifles and an experimental M60 light machine gun. For their triumphant return to production, the manufacturer has restored the vintage 'Tim Mee Toys' logo that hasn't been seen on the shelves for decades. These are real plastic heroes, meant to be set up, knocked down, picked up and played with for years to come! Packed in plastic bag with header card and recommended for ages 5 to 105! ;
