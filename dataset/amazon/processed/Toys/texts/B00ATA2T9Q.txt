Title: Transformers Generations Voyager Class Autobot Springer Figure ; Description: Autobot Springer was built to be a tough guy. Everything about him, from his nickel-plated blaster cannon to his bad-boy attitude, is calculated to communicate exactly what he wants it to &#x2013; that he's a no-holds-barred, take-no-prisoners kind of guy. He prefers to fight alone, trusting his skills and luck to get him out of tight spots rather than relying on his fellow warriors. After all, other Autobots fail, but Autobot Springer never does. Gear up for triple Transformers action with this awesome 3-in-1 Autobot Springer figure! This tough-guy Autobot can launch a fierce missile attack at his Decepticon enemies in robot mode, but if the mission calls for bigger muscle, he can convert to armored car mode. Convert him to helicopter mode just when his Decepticon enemies think they've got him cornered! Keep converting him in 3 different ways so his enemies can't keep up!
