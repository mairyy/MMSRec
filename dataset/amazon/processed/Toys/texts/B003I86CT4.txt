Title: Transformers Generations Blurr ; Description: There are those who suppose, based on his high-speed history and fast-talking demeanor, that BLURR lacks patience. Those people are wrong. He appears to be always on the move because he always has somewhere he needs to be &#x2013; delivering a sensitive data packet, or a round of electro-laser fire to a DECEPTICON squad. When he must wait, he can do so in absolute silence and stillness for hours, until his target is centered in his crosshairs. Turn the tables on enemy forces when you throw this warrior into the fight. Your BLURR figure is dedicated to destroying any opponent and his dual laser blaster accessories will help you two get the job done. ;
