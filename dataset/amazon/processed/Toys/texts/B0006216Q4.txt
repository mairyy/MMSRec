Title: Matchbox Burried Treasure Playset ; Description: Evil pirates are hoarding a treasure chest full of gold doubloons on this menacing playset and kids can attempt to rescue the loot with the red die-cast metal sport-utility vehicle. After mustering up all their courage, kids can board the SUV onto the gangplank, which elevates to the top level and brings them to the pirate cave&#x92;s entrance at the mouth of a spooky skull. The skull emits terrifying pirate sounds and flashes its red eyes, warning the pirates of intruders. At the end of the passage, the vehicle encounters a creaky drawbridge that gives way to send the car tumbling down a waterfall to the first floor. The good will prevail in the end, when kids set off a blast of dynamite that propels the car right into a rock, knocking it out of the way to reveal &#x85; the hidden treasure! A 4-by-2-1/2-inch playmat with a city street layout comes with the set for linking this toy to other playsets within Matchbox&#x92;s Hero City series. The electronic components of this set run via two "AA" batteries.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
