Title: Chuggington Wooden Railway Wilson ; Description: Wilson is a lively multi-function engine with oodles of enthusiasm and confidence. His eagerness isn't always matched by his ability to pay attention, so he has some learning to do about listening and following instructions. He's a bit of a scatterbrain and as such often finds himself in deep water. Wilson sometimes gets frustrated at something new or unfamiliar, but he's always curious and ready to learn. His catchphrases include "It's training time" and "Let's ride the rails!"   Chuggington Wooden Railway combines the charm of wooden train play with the exciting world of Chuggington! Easy-to-connect magnets are simple to connect to other vehicles. Chuggington Wooden Railway is compatible with other wooden track systems. ;
