Title: Fisher-Price Little People Lil' Movers School Bus ; Description: "Stop and go," that&#x92;s what riding the school bus is all about. That and enjoying the bumpy, "wiggly-wobbly" ride, of course! This cute bus will appeal to every toddler and preschooler who has gazed longingly out the window as the big kids board the big yellow bus, off to exotic destinations unknown. Measuring 12 inches long and half again as wide, the durable plastic bus rolls through town, jostling the passengers with the aforementioned "wiggly-wobbly" action. Push down on driver Carlos and see flashing lights, plus hear the "Stop and Go" song, beeping horns, giggling children, and commentary from the driver ("Everyone sit down&#x85;let&#x92;s go to school!" etc.). The bus includes driver, two passengers, a wheelchair for one of the riders, a swiveling stop sign, a door that opens, and easy access through the roof for children to play with the figures. The ideal toy to while away the hours until the real thing arrives in a few years! Check out the entire line of Lil&#x92; Movers vehicles.  Three AA batteries required (not included).
