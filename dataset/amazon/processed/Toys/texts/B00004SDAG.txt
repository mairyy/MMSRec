Title: Turtle Sandbox ; Description: This cute green turtle will allow you to fill him up with 150 pounds of sand for a nice toddler  sandbox. After all that sand is poured in, this turtle won't be going anywhere; when empty, he's easily  portable. He has a green top to keep the rain out, and he sports a friendly, goofy grin. The sandbox is 46  inches from nose to tail, and 40 inches wide. It has durable, double-wall construction.--Richard Farr ;
