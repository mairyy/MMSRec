Title: Racko Card Game - 50th Anniversary ; Description: Like many card games, Rack-O is part skill, part luck of the draw. Two to four players try to get their rack of 10 cards in consecutive order, from lowest to highest, first. The cards are numbered from 1 to 60, and each player takes a turn by drawing and discarding. Bonus Rack-O points are earned when a player gets a perfect run of three or more cards. The first to rack up 500 points wins. The rule book doesn't suggest variations, but more challenge can be added by having to get certain number patterns, like even numbers or multiples of 3, which will also increase the number skills development that's part of this game.--Lynne Sampson ;
