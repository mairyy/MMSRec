Title: Power Grid deck ; Description: The first expansion in the Power Grid 3 expansion pack is the Benelux/Central Europe Map expansion. Along with the maps are small rule changes to reflect the power culture in these two countries. As the Benelux countries support ecological power, players may have greater opportunities to acquire such power plants. Also, oil is more available and coal less available in these countries. As Poland has large coal supplies, coal will be much more plentiful than elsewhere in Central Europe. However, due to political stands taken by some countries, players may be limited in their access to nuclear power. The result is not just new maps, but new ways to play this great game! This expansion 3 pack . Two new expansion maps for Power Grid: Italy on one side and France on the other. Includes minor rules changes based on real-world factors in those regions.

This set of cards has green borders to distinguish them easily from the original set of power plant cards ;
