Title: Go Game with Wood Board ; Description: Go is probably one of the world's most intimidating games, one  which conjures up images of players gleefully setting out for blood as  they devise militaristic board moves. This complex exercise in strategy  originated some 4,000 years ago in the East and has no direct Western  counterpart. The game's playing surface is divided into 361 intersections.  Players place stones on the corners of the squares, and the object is  to surround the stones of their opponents. This edition's wooden game  board is heavy, durable, and has an elegant blond veneer. The plastic  stones are less impressive. The set comes with a first-rate rule book:  filled with diagrams, examples, and a useful recap section midway  through the instructions, it'll make any novice good to Go.--Tony  Mason ;
