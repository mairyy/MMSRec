Title: Fisher-Price Imaginext Monsters University Monsters Scare Factory ; Description: The Monsters Inc. Playset lets you walk through the different Jobs that Mike & Sulley had at Monsters Inc. Beginning with the slide out mailroom on the bottom you can drop in and sort the two scare canisters and three pieces of mail by placing a figure on the disk and rotating it. A cafeteria is located around the back as well for their next job. Also included are a garbage can, broom and dustpan representing time in maintenance. On the left side of the set a platform will rotate out that contains the door repair area and on the right will be a CDA observation deck. Also in the set is the Scare floor where you can see the doors moving through the factory on the back wall (Driven by a disk on the top of package). When you remove a door and place it into its station the station will automatically clamp the door. Place a scare canister on the holder, rotate the disk and watch it fill. Move it to the other side of the factory and you can empty the canister into a large canister, which will fill with the turn of another disk. Included are the playset, Mike, Sulley, 4 doors, 2 scare canisters, 3 pieces of mail, garbage can, dustpan, broom and 4 figure disk activations. ;
