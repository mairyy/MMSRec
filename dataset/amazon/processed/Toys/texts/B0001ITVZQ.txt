Title: Hasbro Heroscape Master Set: Rise of the Valkyrie ; Description: The Heroscape line of toys is like the all-star game of make believe. While other games might focus on a specific era of history, the age of chivalry, perhaps, or the Jurassic period, Heroscape puts everyone together on one enormous madcap battlefield. Vikings, World War II soldiers, ninjas, mutant monsters, samurais, dinosaurs, dragons, robots, they&#x92;re all there, done up as tiny, highly detailed figures. It would be sort of comic if all the players didn&#x92;t look so gosh-darn serious.First, design the 3D landscape of your choice by laying out any combination of the 85 interlocking, plastic hex-shaped pieces. The fact that these can be assembled and stacked in new ways each game means the ensuing battle also changes every time you play. The above mentioned fantasy heroes and historical warriors now converge on your newly created terrain to move, attack, and defend. Multiple dice and game cards indicate combat powers and movement abilities.Just a few of the 30 included figures that Heroscape offers.While there is an included rule book that offers up two game variations (one for players under 8 years of age), we like the boundless imagination of this game and the open-minded versatility of its imaginary protagonists. There is also a battlefield/scenario book that shows five battlefields and how to build them and offers up variation on game objectives. You can decide to make the winning goal opponent elimination, moving to a specific hex, protecting a figure on the board, or something else entirely.What's In the Box30 painted figures8 24-hex tiles10 3-hex tiles2 2-hex tiles26 1-hex tiles21 water tiles2 ruins16 army cards10 glyphs24 wound markersGrenade marker16 order markers10 attack dice10 defense diceA 10-sided dieOwner's sticker sheetRound marker ;
