Title: The World of Eric Carle: The Very Hungry Caterpillar Stackable Blocks by Kids Preferred ; Description: Eric Carle Stacking/Nesting Blocks offers hours of hue-riffic learning for children three years old and up. Each block represents a different animal, and all but the birds has a different tactile or movable feature. The pairing of animals with numbers is subtle but clever. Parents will appreciate the words used to describe an action of each animal: peacock yelping, flamingo fluting, walrus bellowing. The ten paperboard blocks are illustrated with all the characters from the author&#x2019;s books so toddlers will recognize their favorite characters too. ;
