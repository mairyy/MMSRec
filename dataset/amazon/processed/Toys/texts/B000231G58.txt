Title: Trivial Pursuit 1990's Edition ; Description: Who confronted Ivana Trump with: Do you love your husband? Because I do? What sitcom star popularized the Rachel haircut? Who led the 1995 Million Man March on Washington? Capture the scandals and successes of the 1990s in this tin-box time capsule! Okay, you know the routine. Trivial Pursuit's immense popularity is due in part to its rehashing of bizarre, poignant, funny, and sometimes, well, trivial details of life on Planet Earth. The 1990s Edition continues the tradition, allowing two to four adult players (or teams) to pose questions to one another in six categories, including the new Oops (mistakes and mishaps),Wired (technology, gadgets, and the Internet), and Hangin' (what people did in their leisure time) categories. As they correctly answer questions, players move around the board, collecting colored wedges. Includes game board, one deck of 400 question-and-answer cards, five card holders, one 6-sided die, one 10-sided die, four decorated pawns, and 24 scoring wedges.--Emilie Coulter ;
