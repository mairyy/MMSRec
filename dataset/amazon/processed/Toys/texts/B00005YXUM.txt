Title: Trivial Pursuit 20th Anniversary ; Description: If you remember playing the popular original in the early '80s, you may want to get this Trivial Pursuit 20th Anniversary edition for nostalgic reasons. If you remember a lot of the last two decades, you'll want to get this edition to test yourself. Moving around the circular board, players collect wedges for correct answers to questions on "all things trivial from the past 20 years." Examples are: What tennis star was forced to do sit-ups in her crib? What became the third nation in the Western Hemisphere to hit a population of 100 million? What was the lastDunenovel to be written by Frank Herbert? These and the remaining questions are distributed from a fancy new card shoe that is included. The back of the card dispenser has a small compartment for storing the tokens, pie wedges, and die. The board sports a more streamlined look these days, but still folds up into that familiar pie-shaped wedge when game play is over.--Pam Lauer ;
