Title: VTech - Play &amp; Learn Fun Fair ; Description: There&#x92;s so much to do at the fair, babies won&#x92;t know where to begin. They can drop balls down the curvy slide and watch them roll, crank the ferris wheel around to give the balls a ride, or tap on the colorful keyboard to learn numbers, colors, or musical notes. While hard at play, kids will be developing fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination as they grasp and place balls and push the piano keys. The fun fair also teaches cause and effect as children get a different response from the magical sensor for each ball they drop in the slide. Flashing lights and engaging music and sounds stimulate babies&#x92; senses and encourage repeat play. Parents may find the music a bit grating&#x97;especially after they&#x92;ve heard it over and over again. There is a two-level volume control, however, that allows kids to play on a quieter setting. To preserve the battery life, an automatic shut-off feature kicks in if the fair is left untouched for a few minutes. The Play & Learn Fun Fair comes with five colorful balls that conveniently store in the base and runs on two "AA" batteries (included).--Cristina Vaamonde ;
