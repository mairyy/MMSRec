Title: Bandai Tamashii Nations S.H. MonsterArts 2000 Millennium Version Godzilla Action Figure ; Description: Yuji Sakai continues his master crafted kaiju figures with this latest sculpt of S.H.MonsterArts Godzilla 2000 Millennium version. In addition to meticulously crafted detail (each individual tooth and characteristic scaly back plate has been meticulously sculpted), S.H.MonsterArts Godzilla 2000 will boast the most advanced articulation of any of the previously released Godzilla's, as well as the longest tail of any figure in the series. The Millennium version of the King of the Monsters had a noticeably leaner, meaner sculpt than his predecessors. Truly a centerpiece for any Godzilla fan and perfect for any S.H.MonsterArts collector. ;
