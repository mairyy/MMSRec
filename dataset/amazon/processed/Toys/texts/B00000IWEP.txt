Title: The Game of SCATTERGORIES ; Description: Scattergories is a fast-paced word game that's a real crowd pleaser. Each player takes a category  list with 12 categories--such as vegetable, state, president, things you throw away--and must write down the  name of one item that fits into each category. Sounds easy enough, but each item has to begin with a  specific letter that is determined when the 20-sided die is rolled. For instance, you roll the letter "R." Your  answer list for the above categories might look something like this: rutabaga, Rhode Island, Roosevelt,  rubbish, etc. You have to think fast, because a round lasts only 3 minutes! Players score points for each  unique answer.--Alison Golder ;
