Title: Batman Begins Batmobile Vehicle ; Description: Black and stealthy--with rubber wheels and a rock-solid, plastic construction--this Batmobile looks and feels more like an armored tank. Atop the vehicle sit three red buttons. Press the first one, and an engine revs and a huge red light at the rear flashes. Press the second, and hidden missile launchers spring from either side of the car with a clatter. (You can easily fold them closed again.) The third button creates the sound effect of missiles firing. A hatch on top opens to reveal the driver&#x92;s seat and a rotating steering control. Accompanied by three button-cell batteries, this heavy-duty toy rolls smoothly along the floor. Action figures are sold separately.--Andy Boynton ;
