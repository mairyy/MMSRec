Title: Strawberry Shortcake Berry Happy Home ; Description: Where would you think someone like Strawberry Shortcake would live? In a condo in the city? This strawberry scented home, which opens to reveal its contents, is the preferred residence of everyone's favorite fruit themed cartoon heroine. It features a turning closet, a grandfather clock that chimes, a ringing doorbell, a rocking chair, lamp, and a small television set. No dolls are included here making it more of an accessory for a fan of Ms. Shortcake who already has a collection of thematic products. Still, since there are so many cozy accoutrements of home, one could easily introduce existing dolls or even action figures into the Strawberry Shortcake landscape, even if one has no Strawberry Shortcake dolls available. Let Luke Skywalker pick out some outfits in the closet, give Barbie a chance to get away from her own dream house for the weekend. The possibilities are endless.--Charlie Williams ;
