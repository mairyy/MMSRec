Title: Scrabble Electronic Catchphrase Game ; Description: Think fast. The Scrabble Electronic Catchphrase game challenges you to come up with words and then pass the game fast so you don&#x2019;t get caught holding the bag. Give your teammates clues so they can guess the word or phrase on the game unit&#x2019;s screen. But no rhyming, first letters or parts of the word, or the other team gets a point. Once your team has guessed it, pass the unit fast to the other team. When the buzzer goes off, whoever has the unit loses a point to the other side, so move fast. When your team gets to 7 points, you win. ;
