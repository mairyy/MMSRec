Title: Formula D ; Description: Formula D transports you into the turbulent world of Formula 1: Don't lose control of the engine in the last bottleneck, master the chicane, stick to your opponent's back wheels, take advantage of the slip stream and then coolly overtake him.  A Formula 1 driver has to be willing to take risks and be able to plan ahead... at least if you want to get to the very top of the winner's podium.   Formula D also adds an alternate version of play including the suspense of illegal racing on the streets of the big cities.  Anything goes: customized cars, nitro fuel injection, skidding in roundabouts, unfair tricks.  The game principles always stay the same, but different cars, rules and circuits come into play. ;
