Title: Crayola 50ct Washable Super Tips with Silly Scents ; Description: Yes, this pack really does contain 50 distinct colors. Each  6.5-inch felt-tipped pen has a white barrel and a color-coordinated  cap, and variations of pink through red alone require about 10  different pens. (It depends on where you think purple ends, or orange  begins.) Each pen has a conical tip that makes drawing thick or thin  lines easy. And when you have all 50 colors on your best white shirt,  it's nice to know that the inks are washable. The only drawback is that  the pens come in a thin transparent plastic case that will probably not  survive daily use.--Richard Farr ;
