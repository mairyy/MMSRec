Title: Plan Toy Baby Walker ; Description: Plan Toy Baby Walker has joined innovation with "old world toys" by crafting a progressive tool for crawlers who would be walkers. An adjustable handle, a low center of gravity and 24 natural and colored unit blocks make this cheerful looking toy a must for any collection. Made from recycled rubber wood and colored with natural stains, when they aren't using it for building future skyscrapers, it will invite your crawler to his or her feet and get them moving. ;
