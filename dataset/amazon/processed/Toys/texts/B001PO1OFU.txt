Title: Kettrike Junior ; Description: The Kettler name has been synonymous with top quality wheel toys for kids for more than 40 years, and the Kettler Kettrike Junior Tricycle is no exception to the Kettler quality and design standards. The frame is constructed with high-carbon steel to last a lifetime and a fade-resistant polyester powder-coat finish with sturdy molded plastic components. Designed to grow with your child, the brightly colored Kettrike Junior Trike will provide boys and girls with years of fun through multiple stages of development from one year old through six years old. With the included removable chrome-plated push bar, the Kettrike Junior Trike evolves from a parent-directed ride-on toy to an independently operated tricycle, all the while growing in size along with your child.The Kettrike Junior Trike has a four-position telescoping frame with one bolt release so it can grow with your child or be used by multiple children. The four-position adjustable high-back seat with a handhold is appropriate and supportive enough for one year olds and sturdy for rough-riding four year olds. The parent-operated chrome-plated push bar allows kids to ride and enjoy the trike long before they learn to pedal, as young as 12 months old or as soon as they can grip the handles. The push bar can be removed easily as soon as your child is ready to pedal on his own.As your child grows he or she will be able to reach and operate the pedals, first with the guidance of an adult helping with the push bar, and eventually on his or her own. Pedaling the trike helps kids build confidence and leg strength as they explore independently. Designed to be safe for young riders, the Kettrike Junior has wide synthetic MaxXtread tires that provide excellent traction for all-terrain riding and are super stable. The trike has a low center of gravity and limited turn radius steering that restricts the handlebars and front wheel from turning more than 45 degrees to the left or right, radically reducing the danger of tipping over. The trike is also equipped with a fun rear-tipping bucket that is great for both carrying and collecting supplies and is easy to remove and clean when necessary. The Kettler Kettrike Junior Tricycle is a standout toy for both its quality and its longevity.Specifications:Recommended ages: 1 to 6 years oldFour-position telescoping frame with one bolt releaseFour-position adjustable high-back seat with hand holdChrome-plated push bar includedHigh-carbon steel frameFade-resistant polyester powder-coat finishLimited turn radius steering deviceSynthetic MaxXtread tires for a smooth and quiet rideRemovable tipping bucketDimensions: 21 x 20 x 23 inches (HxWxD)Seat: 10 inches highSeat to floor distance: 10 inchesSeat to pedal distance: 16 inches to 20.5 inches (to measure sit child on floor, bend knee up slightly, measure from hip to heel)Wheel size: 9" / 7"Weight limit: 200 poundsAssembly requiredWhat's in the Box?Tricycle and components, chrome-plated pushbarManufacturer WarrantyThree-year limited manufacturer's warranty ;
