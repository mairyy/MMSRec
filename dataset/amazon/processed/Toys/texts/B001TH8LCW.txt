Title: Incan Gold: Quest for Riches in the Ruins ; Description: Incan Gold (co-designed by Alan R. Moon, designer of Ticket to Ride) is a quick, fun game of bluff and daring in which explorers push their luck while exploring an old Incan temple in search of gold and treasure. In each round, you decide whether to delve deeper into the temple, adding to your riches, or escape with the share you've acquired so far. Every time an explorer braves new territory, more gems and dangers appear. Giant spiders, mummies and fire can cause you to lose everything. Is it worth the risk? You decide.

After five rounds of exploration, whoever has the most treasure is the ultimate explorer and the winner.. ;
