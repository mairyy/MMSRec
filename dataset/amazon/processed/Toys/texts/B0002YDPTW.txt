Title: GeoTrax Coastal Winds Airport ; Description: Reach new heights with this airport play set from GeoTrax. At the center sits an air-traffic-control tower from which a rod extends holding an airplane. A motor flies the plane in a 360-degree circle around the tower and spins its propellers, while a hand control lets little ones raise and lower the plane and land it on a curved runway. To the side, a crane loads freight from a rotating blue cubby into a red train. Accessories include a windsock, a sign, cargo crates, and three track pieces which you can attach to other GeoTrax sets. Three C batteries are required but sold separately.--Andy Boynton ;
