Title: ThinkFun Hyper Swipe ; Description: Hyper Swipe puts your reflexes to the test as you race against your opponents to collect the most pattern matches. You&#8217;ll have to work at hyper-speed to be the first to identify matches between the square cards in your hand and the circle cards that automatically pop-up from the Hyper Swiper device. The most matches win. These patterns can be tricky and it takes a keen eye to match them.  Unique circle cards that make you swap your hand with an opponent plus bonus and penalty point cards mix up the play.  Fun for the entire family. ;
