Title: McFarlane Toys The Walking Dead TV Series 4 Dixon Brother Action Figure Playset, 2-Pack ; Description: AMC's The Walking Dead television series is now the most watched drama in basic cable history, shattering records along the way with the release of each new season. Season 3 finds Rick Grimes and his fellow survivors continuing to seek refuge in a desolate and post-apocalyptic world and soon discover that there are greater forces to fear than just the walking dead. The struggle to survive has never been so perilous and McFarlane Toys is sitting shotgun for the ride with its fourth series of AMC's The Walking Dead action figures. Two badass, backwoods, rebel yelling redneck brothers thrust against an unyielding onslaught of ravenous undead. Both original Atlanta survivors, Daryl and Merle Dixon have proven time and again, blood is thicker than brain matter. Family reunions can be a bitter sweet pill to swallow, especially in a world inhabited by The Walking Dead. Using a 3D scan of the actors themselves, both of these highly detailed figures feature the exact likeness of the characters from the show. The Daryl Dixon figure features 20 points of articulation and includes a crossbow, hunting knife, fire axe, pick axe and prison keys. The Merle Dixon figure is re-armed and ready for action with 20 points of articulation, prosthetic arm with bayonet, assault rifle, pistol and knife. ;
