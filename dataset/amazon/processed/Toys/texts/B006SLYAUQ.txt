Title: Hexbug Scarab (Colors May Vary) ; Description: The HEXBUG&#xAE; Scarab is an exceptionally high-speed, mechanical, beetle-like robotic bug that skitters around on six angled legs. The high energy micro robotic creature propels itself forwards and backwards, and is capable of popping from its back to its feet if placed upside down. The Scarab&#x2019;s lifelike behavior is eerily mesmerizing to watch and interact with. Packed with advanced design and engineering, each Scarab has an inner body loaded with robotic intelligence, protected by a hard, transparent exoskeleton casing. ;
