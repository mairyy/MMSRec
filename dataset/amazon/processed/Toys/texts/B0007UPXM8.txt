Title: My Little Pony: So Soft Pony - Good Morning Sunshine ; Description: Daddy can make good on his promise to buy his little girl a pony with Good Morning Sunshine, an interactive version of the My Little Pony dolls. Sunshine is dressed in pajamas and reacts to things the way a human baby does, which can be a little disconcerting when first spotting her pink horsey head and flowing pink-and-yellow mane and tail where human features would normally be. However, once it&#x92;s established that Sunshine is a horse, her interactive features are quite cute. This baby pony arrives asleep and but rubbing her back wakes her up. Sunshine&#x92;s eyes open and she sits up and says "Good morning, Mommy!" and then proceeds to giggle and say a few of the other six phrases in her repertoire (such as "Let&#x92;s play!" and "Can I have a kiss?"). While awake, Sunshine takes a bottle or a pacifier and makes realistic eating and sucking sounds (although the pacifier ultimately puts Sunshine back to sleep). To keep Sunshine awake, Mommies must stroke her back or squeeze her left foot; if ignored, she will lie down, say "Good night," and go to sleep again. Sunshine wears cozy pink pajamas but has a hard plastic body that may make her a little uncomfortable to sleep next to. She comes with a brush to maintain her mane and requires four "AA" batteries (included) for operation.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
