Title: Lego Series 7 Hippie Mini Figure ; Description: Make LEGO models, not war! The friendly, good-natured Hippie loves everything in the entire world. Rain and shine, day and night, puppies and kittens they all bring a happy smile to his face. With a fashion sense that hasnt changed since the Sixties, he never stays in the same place for long, preferring to roam across city and countryside alike, stopping only to smell the flowers and spread his simple message of peace, love and LEGO bricks.

Instead, he believes that true creativity lies in making a big pile of your bricks and putting them together in whatever way most inspires your imagination. According to him, its the ultimate groovy way to reveal your true inner soul as a builder! Blind bag opened to confirm contents. These figures come in a zip-lock bag.
