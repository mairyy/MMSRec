Title: BRIO Mighty Red Locomotive ; Description: Here you have it: the little engine that could. It's a fiery red choo-choo with shining wheels and glossy black trim--a locomotive that will get even the most stubborn loads up and over that hill in time for breakfast. It can haul as many as eight (or more) full-size cars. And it's packed with features, too: flip the power switch, push the yellow button on the front, and it roars into action--whistle blowing, engine chugging, double front headlamp lighting up the track. Another button sends it into reverse--"Clang! Clang!" warns the bell, and the engine begins chugging backward, a flashing red rear light warning off unwary bystanders. A third button stops the engine instantly--even when it's running full speed ahead. It's simple enough for even a very young railway worker to operate easily (our 4-year-old test driver figured it out first), and if it doesn't get into the action after about five minutes, it shuts off automatically. The battery compartment hidden in the smokestack requires a small screwdriver for access. The locomotive requires two AAA batteries (not included).--Julie Ubben ;
