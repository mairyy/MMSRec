Title: Mr. Potato Head Silly Suitcase ; Description: Movie star, master of disguise, starchy tuber extraordinaire: is there anything Mr. Potato Head can't do? This specimen comes with 25 different features to mix and match, including glasses, ears, mustache, lips, arms, eyes, and hat. There's even a sticking-out tongue, in case he's feeling especially silly. All the pieces tuck inside his body for storage, and the whole shebang packs up into a plastic suitcase for face-making fun on the go.--Mary Park ;
