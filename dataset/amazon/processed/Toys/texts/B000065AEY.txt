Title: Insect Lore Ant Hill ; Description: Give your children the gift of nature with the Ant Hill from Insect Lore. This kit is the first ant habitat designed like the real thing. The dome-shaped, see-through home offers a crosscut view, so kids can easily view ants burrowing and tunneling through the sand and foraging for food above ground. This kit comes with a coupon to send away for live ants through the mail, and it is recommended for kids ages six and up with adult supervision. ;
