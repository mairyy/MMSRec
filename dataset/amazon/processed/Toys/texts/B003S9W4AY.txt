Equip yourself with amazing items like the Chainmail Bikini and the Stab-A-Matic . . . and show them who's the mightiest, munchkinest dungeon delver of them all.    And this set has a special treat. We asked five of our favorite Comic Guys to do one card each. So in this set you'll find:        * Phil Foglio's Magnificent Hat      * Pete Abrams' Perfectly Ordinary Rabbit      * Tom Ricket's Stick Figure      * Jon Rosenberg's Fowl Fiend      * and Randy Milholland's Redneck Tree!    Munchkin 3 &#x2013; Clerical Errors is a supplement to Munchkin; you will need the original game to play. Or you could add it to a game of Munchkin, Munchkin Fu, or Munchkin Bites! instead, or mix them all together for a Munchkin-fest of truly mind-bending proportions!    Now in Full Color! ;
