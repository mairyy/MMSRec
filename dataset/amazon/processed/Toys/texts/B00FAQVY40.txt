Title: Disney Planes Action Shifters Flight to the Finish Speedway ; Description: This Action Shifters track set is inspired by the high-flying thrills of Disney&#x2019;s Planes! Join small town hero Dusty as he goes for his dream to be a world-class racer. At the Flight To The Finish Speedway, kids pull back on the Action Shifters handle to send two planes racing through the track! Pit villainous champ Ripslinger against our hero and see them whip around the control tower and pick up speed as they try to outperform one another - just like they do in the film! Time it just right by pulling the Action Shifters handle again and again to keep them racing! There are multiple levels to climb and ways to master a peak performance. With the included Supercharged Dusty plane, you can practice first place racing chops. Sky-high fun is in store for everyone! ;
