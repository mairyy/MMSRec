Title: LEGO Creator Winter Village Post Office 10222 ; Description: Deliver sacks full of holiday greetings and gifts in the cozy Winter Village Post Office! Continuing the winter scene series, the Winter Village Post Office is the perfect snow-covered setting.  In the cozy post office, the worker is hard at work sorting all the mail into containers and sacks, while upstairs, there's just time for the postman to take a break before setting off in the traditional post car with all the letters and gifts.  From the pavilion outside, musicians fill the air with music, while children take in the wintry atmosphere by the park bench before throwing snowballs at each other - the musicians had better get ready to duck! ;
