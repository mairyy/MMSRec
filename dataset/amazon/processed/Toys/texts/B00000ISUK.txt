Title: Thomas and Friends Train Play Set - Thomas Big Loader ; Description: Watch out for falling rock! Railroad construction ahead!  Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends Big Loader will bring out the train conductor in any child. When the big loader is running, use the control buttons on the track to make the train change direction. Itsy-bitsy engineers control whatever it does next. The track includes hoppers, loading docks, and transfer ramps. The motorized chassis fits under Thomas, Percy, and Terrance, the toys' included companions. After parents take a few minutes to read the simple instructions, make sure a 2-by-2-foot space is available for construction. Requires one AA battery for operation.--Andrea Linsky ;
