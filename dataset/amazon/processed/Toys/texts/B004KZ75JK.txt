Title: Ravensburger Race To The Roof - Children'S Game ; Description: From the basement to the attic. Can you make it to the attic before anyone else? Starting at the front door, roll the die and race through the different rooms. Roll a 6 and take an object card - you might leap forward or take a huge step backwards. No two games are alike on this varying game board. Finding the objects in the rooms supports recognition and association skills. ;
