Title: Rock-A-Bye CHOU CHOU Doll ; Description: Rock-a-bye baby--when this doll is patted, the crying will stop. Rock A Bye  Chou Chou makes lots of cooing and burbling sounds, and just like a real baby, she cries  for attention, too. She can be comforted by patting her firmly on the back or by giving her  a bottle or her own pink pacifier. When Chou Chou is placed on her back to sleep, her  blue eyes close, and she "falls asleep" with gentle, regular breathing sounds. When she's  picked up, her eyes pop open and she "wakes up" with giggling or crying. The 19-inch  doll has the same high-quality materials and construction of all Zapf dolls, with a pretty,  hard-vinyl face, molded vinyl hands and feet, and bean-filled arms and legs for a cuddly  feel. Rock A Bye Chou Chou wears a pink and white sleeper with a matching cap, and  she requires three AA batteries (not included) to power her coos and cries.--Marcie  Bovetz ;
