Title: Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Baseball ; Description: Brilliant Basics Bat'n Cheer Baseball really gets baby swinging!  In mode 1, the soft baseball is attached to the springy base for sitting babies bat-at play. When baby is standing in mode 2, the post extends and the ball comes loose for real t-ball play. In either mode, every time baby bats at the ball with his hand or with the realistic shaped bat, he is rewarded with 1 of 2 instrumental tunes (like "Take me out to the Ballgame") or 1 of 3 SFX (crowd cheers, "Home Run", and the crack of the bat).  Baby will love the great springy action of the t-ball post.  Includes 1 soft baseball and 1 bat. ;
