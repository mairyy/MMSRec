Title: Little Touch LeapPad - Pink ; Description: With a little help from a bigger friend (parent, guardian&#x85;), young children can launch into the world of learning via interactive books. Little Touch LeapPad is designed for tots 6 to 36 months, with three distinct levels of activities and stories: musical rhythms and sounds; short descriptive phrases; and rhymes and early learning. Stories or activity cards snap into the book frame, along with a story cartridge. Grownups will need to help little ones activate the book pages by touching the "Go" button every time a page is turned, as well as showing young "readers" how to touch pictures to make them come to life with developmentally appropriate narration and learning activities. A comfy cushion is attached to the LeapPad platform for cozy shared reading time. Four AA batteries required (not included).--Emilie Coulter ;
