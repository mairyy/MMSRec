Title: Barbie as The Princess and The Pauper:  Interactive Serafina Plush Doll with 10-minute Audio CD ; Description: Serafina, the pampered snowy-white companion of Princess Anneliese, certainly does not lack self-esteem. This chatty kitty burbles over with more than 75 one-liners, including, Iamquite the talented kitty, and Ilovelooking pretty. Squeeze her paw, stroke her back, kiss her nose, and Serafina responds with words, songs, purrs, head tosses, tail wags, and, of course, meows. Additionally, when her human friends set up Serafina's jewelry box next to a CD player and insert Serafina's Adventure (included), signals from the CD and jewelry box cause Serafina to do her feline thing! She'll also respond to theBarbie as The Princess and the Pauperand other Serafina DVDs and videos. Measuring a good 22 inches from pink-tipped ears to long fluffy tail, Serafina has blue eyes, a gem-studded crown, and a matching heart-shaped locket, as well as a brush to keep that lush pelt sleek and smooth. Her jewelry box requires one 9-volt battery (not included), and Kitty herself requires three AA batteries (Try Me batteries included, but you'll need fresh ones).--Emilie Coulter ;
