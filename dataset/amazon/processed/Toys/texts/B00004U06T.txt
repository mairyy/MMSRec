Title: Star Kitchen ; Description: For playing house, restaurant, or sidewalk snack stand, this  colorful kitchen appliance combination--with light-up, cooking-sound  burners--fills all the needs of the imaginative little chef. Throw some  chow in a pan and turn on either of the burners. One makes sizzling  frying noises, and the other makes seething boiling sounds. The  3-foot-tall food prep center assembles easily with a guiding hand from Mom or  Dad. The set includes adjustable blue shelves, rotating green shelves,  slide-out yellow shelves, hook hangers, a drying rack and dishes, cups,   utensils, pans, serving implements, food (tomato, hot dogs, French  fries, sunny-side-up eggs, fish, and steak), a refrigerator, an oven, and  even the kitchen sink! The Star Kitchen comes with instructions (in 12  languages) for assembly and use. Burners operate on two AA batteries,  which are not included.--Ava Natov ;
