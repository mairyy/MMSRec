Title: ScienceWiz / Inventions Kit ; Description: Get ready to create working projects right at home with theScienceWiz Inventionskit. Build a spinning motor, a clicking telegraph, a light flashing generator and a real radio!Step-by-step, highly visual instructions lead a child successfully through each invention. The full color illustrations present central scientific concepts which allow children to discover the "why" as well as the "how" of these four great projects and the use of everyday materials demystifies the workings of common electronic components. Bring the fun and learning further by utilizing the animations that compliment the book on the ScienceWiz website to deepen and extend comprehension.Although designed for 8 year olds, Inventions has an extraordinary history and following and has even been used at MIT to mentor high school students in physics and at U.C. Berkeley to mentor women in science. It has been used similarly at other institutions including the Fermi Lab and the University of Texas at Austin. It was rumored that a number of physicists at U.C. Berkeley were spinning the handmade motors on their desks competing to see which motor would spin the fastest! Inventions received a rave review from the Women's Society of the IEEE after using it for camp programs for elementary school students. The IEEE's review boasted, "The projects actually WORK....even for large groups where individualized attention is not possible."The award winningScienceWizline got its start in 1995 when we released our first title ScienceWiz Electricity. Our line of science kits stemmed from Dr. Penny Norman's volunteer work teaching science in her children's elementary schools and her ScienceWiz after school and summer programs. With initial development supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and the Franklin Foundation, each of our kits is created with the goal of teaching fundamental scientific concepts to children through hands-on play. ;
