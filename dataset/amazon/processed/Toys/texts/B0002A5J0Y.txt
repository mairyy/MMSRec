Title: Strawberry Shortcake: Filly Groomin' Salon With Honey Pie Pony ; Description: Honey-Pie's giving My Little Ponies a run for their money&#x97;perhaps through a strawberry field. He's just as cute, just as soft, and smells wonderful. Appropriate for such a fantastic filly, the included grooming stable is replete with Honey Pie's every need, mainly curlers and bows for his color-changing mane. His cleverly themed, ice cream parlor stable must have been the work of Strawberry Shortcake herself!Diane Beall ;
