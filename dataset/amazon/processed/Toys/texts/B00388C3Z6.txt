Title: Fisher-Price Handy Manny Construction Site Playset ; Description: It&#8217;s time to construct and destruct with Manny! Transport materials using Manny&#8217;s dump truck. Roll the &#8220;crawler&#8221; crane along then remove the wheels to turn it into a crane tower. Load cinder blocks from the cement mixer into the dump truck and wheel barrow and transport them to the building site. Use the parts to build City Hall, and if you make a mistake, don&#8217;t worry &#8211; just use the wrecking ball to knock the building down and start all over again! Over 45 pieces including Manny, Rusty, Felipe and Eduardo figures plus a working crane with three attachments (wrecking ball, hook and claw), dump truck, cement loader, cinder blocks, wheelbarrow, shovel and more. ;
