Title: Disney Frozen Swirling Snow Sleigh ; Description: Disney Frozen Swirling Snow Sleigh: In the Disney film Frozen, an entire mountain of ice, snow and non-stop adventure stands before Anna of the Kingdom of Arendelle. This sturdy and majestic sled is perfect for completing a treacherous, snowy journey. And with room for two, Anna can ride along her travel companion, the brave and adventurous mountain man, Kristoff (sold separately) - just like in the movie! Together or alone, Anna can speed through the snow and ice, leaving a cloud of snowflakes in her path. As girls push the sleigh along, a flurry of &#x201C;snow&#x201D; swirls within the clear compartment at the back - a snowy surprise that will both delight and excite young imaginations! The icy blue-colored sled features realistic elements that include runners, footboards and wintry accents, as well as flower designs that match Anna's signature Norwegian rosemaling-inspired print recognizable from the film. Small doll Anna is dressed for the cold, with a removable skirt and cape to add extra layers. She features molded boots and gloves as well as her pretty braids and gorgeous tiara. Girls will love reenacting the adventures this carefree and courageous character experiences through the mountain in her majestic ride. The sleigh comes with an Anna small doll. ;
