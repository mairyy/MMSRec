Title: Earlyears Pound n' Play ; Description: International Playthings Pound &#x91;n Play is designed for the busy baby who enjoys repeating an  activity and using his hands. The box--with four color-coded holes to match the colored balls with funny  faces, an inside ramp, and a mirror--will provide endless fun and learning for your youngster. The included  hammer will help him to practice medium-sized movements, and replacing the balls in their holes to be  pounded will develop hand-eye coordination. This may be a perfect toy for a child who is less inclined to  do very fine motor work and who needs to use up a little spare energy. It is made of lightweight, sturdy,  brightly colored plastic that will withstand thousands of poundings.--Sandy Hirsch ;
