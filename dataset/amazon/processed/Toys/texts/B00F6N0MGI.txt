Title: Fisher-Price Imaginext Alpha Explorer ; Description: With the Fisher-Price Imaginext Alpha Explorer, kids become part of an outer space world of adventures where they control the action! Look out, there's an asteroid headed straight for the space station! Young space enthusiasts help protect the Alpha Explorer by using the moveable projectile launcher to blast away incoming objects! When it's time to explore the depths of space, kids turn the activation disk on the base of the station to release the hose connectors and prepare the shuttle for launch. Then they place the space figure in the cockpit and press the button on the shuttle to hear a countdown. 3...2...1...Blast-off! Now it's time to grab the shuttle and fly through outer space, firing "laser" projectiles at any aliens (sold separately) they encounter! Mission complete! Requires 2 AAA batteries for sound effects & phrases. ;
