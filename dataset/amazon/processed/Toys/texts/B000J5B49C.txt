Title: InStep Pink Lady Pedal Car ; Description: Offering a stylish, old-fashioned design with authentic detailing, the InStep Pink Lady pedal car lets your child's imagination (and feet) run wild. Based on the design of the best-selling "Dip Side" pedal car from the 1950s, this InStep pedal car lives up to its name with a bright pink, lead-free paint job, and your child can customize its looks with the included decal sheet--including adding her name. The car, which fits a wide range of children, features a durable solid steel frame that holds up to use and abuse through the years, along with a functional steering wheel that's easy to steer. The rubber tires and chrome hub caps, meanwhile, not only feel smooth but offer a sleek, streamlined look. Some assembly required.
