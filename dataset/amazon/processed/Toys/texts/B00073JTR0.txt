Title: ThinkFun Tipover ; Description: Fans of Rush Hour will enjoy the leap from linear to 3-dimensional in this dramatic crate game. After setting up the game board according to pictures on each challenge card, players must create a path to the red crate by tipping over the blue, yellow, and green crates. But there&#x2019;s a catch. You have to get your Tipper there without jumping over crates or allowing him to touch the game board. TIPOVER introduces players to spatial relationships and the laws of cause and effect. ;
