Kill the monster; grab the treasure; stab your buddy. That's what it's all about. Now Munchkin Questbrings the action to the gameboard. Cooperate with the whole group; adventure with a partner; or strike out on your own. You don't know what's behind a door until you open it; and then another room is added to the dungeon. Battle monsters for power and treasure; or send them after your friends. Reach Level 10; and then get out alive if you can. Designed by Steve Jackson; and illustrated by John Kovalic; this boardgame doesn't take itself seriously. Except for the loot &#x2013; munchkins are always serious about that. Coming this year to game rooms everywhere. ;
