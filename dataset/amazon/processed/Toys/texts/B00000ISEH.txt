Title: TOMY Gearation Building Toy ; Description: With its ingenious design, the Gearation Activity Set lets  preschoolers assemble clicking, whirring, googly-eyed machines all by  themselves. Eleven colorful plastic gears adhere magnetically to a  14-by-16-inch easel, so kids are free to arrange them in any order they can  dream up. The gear in the center powers the whole contraption. The  various gears (each measuring from 1 to 3 inches across) all do  something different, whether it's making a noise or just turning a  brightly colored arm, and kids can control the gear speeds with fat,  easy-to-grab switches. And since all the parts are cleverly connected by  magnets, you don't have to worry about the motor burning out.--Paul  Hughes ;
