Instructions, product description Cute and portable &#x2013; these floating three-dimensional figures are cherished by girls ages 6 and up. Each thumb-sized character has its own look, sounds and songs and lives inside a raindrop-shaped case. The creatures come alive when kids, or other Aquapets, interact with them. A microchip, microphone and speaker housed in the toy&#x2019;s base enable Aquapets to register and respond to sound. Each character replies with movement and melody. The more you play with your Aquapets, the more songs they will perform and the livelier they&#x2019;ll become. ;
