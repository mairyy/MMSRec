Title: Musical Activity Walker ; Description: This versatile toy starts as a fun-filled activity center with lively music, beads, gears, and colorful doors. Then it converts into a fully mobile walker, ready to steady the mobile child. Four fun songs reward baby for the great physical accomplishment of walking on either carpeted or hardwood surfaces, providing the incentive to keep on practicing. (For quieter play the music can also be turned off.) Although perhaps most suitable for more stable toddlers that enjoy the thrill of being able to push toys around, this durable walker will soon become a favorite friend. It also folds flat for easy storage and requires three AA alkaline batteries (not included).--Deb Oroszlan ;
