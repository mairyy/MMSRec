Title: The Farming Game ; Description: More than 350,000 copies of The Farming Game ("The Game Invented  on the Seat of a Tractor") have been sold, and this 20th-anniversary  edition introduces a new generation to the joys of muck and milking.  Every player starts the game with 20 inherited acres and moves through  the months (i.e., around the board) trying to build the farm into an  independent, successful concern that will feed the whole family. A fun  game, it also has a serious, educational side--having been invented by  George Rohrbacher, a farmer in Washington State's Yakima Valley, who  thought it up while trying to figure out how to make enough cash to hang  on to his family farm. Up to six players, ages 10 to adult.--Richard  Farr ;
