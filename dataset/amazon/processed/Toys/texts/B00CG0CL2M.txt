They get busy filling orders, using charts, estimating the right-size goody packages and catching the correct ingredients to make tasty treats. Your little math whiz will use estimation skills to guess how many jellybeans are in the jar and create a chart to figure out the favorite flavor of the day.

Every level is a new day packed full of fun and reward, and with up to 10 themed quests, there's always something new to learn and discover! Core skills taught include Tables, Charts and Graphs, Estimation, Number Sense, and Sorting and Classifying.The LeapFrog DifferenceLeapFrog has created a playful learning environment that is developmentally appropriate for children ages 4 to 7 years. "A robust, diverse title for developing mathematicians, Hello Kitty brings together foundational skills such as number recognition and shape knowledge with equally important but less familiar skills such as estimation and reading tables, charts and graphs. The game is set in recognizable, lifelike scenarios, showing children that mathematics is all around them and is important for real life."   - Jody L., LeapFrog Learning ExpertInnovative Learning ApproachHello Kitty provides a curriculum rich in math-related subjects that explore the estimation of both quantity and space. New concepts are presented in ways familiar to children so that they can generalize their game experiences to the real world. An estimation task asks children to estimate how many jellybeans are in a jar and a chart exercise has children interpret various types of charts and fill the appropriate number of items through a fun play pattern.What's In The Box?The LeapFrog Hello Kitty Sweet Little Shops Learning Game app includes game cartridge and Parent Guide & Instruction Book.Explorer learning games work with LeapPad Ultra, LeapPad2, LeapPad2 Power, LeapPad1, LeapsterGS and Leapster Explorer (sold separately). ;
