Title: Step2 Ladybug Sandbox ; Description: This cute, red plastic ladybug isn't going to fly away home because she's  really a two-piece junior sandbox. And, you're going to put a couple of 50-pound bags of  sand in her. But that's okay; she's just the right size for the kind of beach-kid who is very  interested in eating the grainy stuff. She's 34 inches in diameter, 6 inches deep, and has a  raised leaf design on the bottom. Her shell is decorated with a central groove and three  pairs of dots, and is connected to the base with a black plastic tether. Big black, green,  and white eyes (and a little red nose) give her a winsome expression.--Richard Farr ;
