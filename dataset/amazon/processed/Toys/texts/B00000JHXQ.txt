Title: Thomas &amp; Friends Wooden Railway - Mavis ; Description: Assigned to the Farquhar Quarry Co., Ltd., Mavis is one of the hardest-working engines on the Thomas Wooden Railway System. Still, by her smile and bright eyes, we can tell that this six-wheeled, 3.25-inch-long worker bears her burdens cheerfully. Made of sturdy wood and plastic, black-and-white Mavis is part of a whole creative system of train-car characters, wooden tracks, and scenery based on the popular Thomas the Tank Enginebook, television, andvideoseries. She attaches to other cars via heavy-duty magnets. Like all Thomas Wooden Railway parts, Mavis carries a lifetime warranty.--Joan DeClaire ;
