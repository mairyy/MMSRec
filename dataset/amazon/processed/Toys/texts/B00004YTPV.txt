Title: 76&quot; x 47&quot; Whale Ride on ; Description: Finally, a Shamu of your very own: an inflatable Orca, minus the teeth. At 6  feet long, he'd take up the whole bathtub, but is ideal for endless rides in the pool. There  are two big grab-handles cemented to the sides. Unless you have an Orca's deep-sea lungs  yourself, we recommend a good pump for this one.--Richard Farr ;
