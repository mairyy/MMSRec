Title: Schleich Landariel with Unicorn foal ; Description: All elves love animals and all animals live in harmony with the elves. Nevertheless, a friendship like the one between the gentle elf girl Lindariel and the little elf foal Amira is something quite special. Lindariel spends all her time with little Amira, pets her, feeds her and tells her all that she knows. Sometimes the two go jumping on the meadow along the stream, then they dream on under a willow tree. These two are so happy together that they beam with joy. ;
