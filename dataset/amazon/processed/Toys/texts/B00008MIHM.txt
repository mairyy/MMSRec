Title: Bulls-Eye Ball ; Description: At first glance, Bullz-I-Ball seems like a miniature version of a popular arcade game, where players have to throw miniature basketballs into rings of three different levels to score points. But with another look at this handheld ball game, players will see the twist&#x97;the balls have to first bounce off a built-in mini-trampoline before going into any of the three levels of targets. Bullz-I-Balls builds on eye-hand coordination as three different electronic games challenge players to increase their scores. The game 30-Second Blitz gives players 30 seconds to score as many points as they can, 25-Point Rush's object is to gain 25 points in as little time as possible, and Bulls-Eye Ace challenges players to make as many bulls-eyes as they can until they have 10 misses and game's up. Cool music and sound effects accompany game-playing and an electronic announcer gives play-by-play updates and encouragement.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
