Title: Schylling Kids Accordion ; Description: Your child probably doesn't knowLawrence Welkor the accordion he toted around so famously for years. That should work in the favor of this sturdy, enjoyable instrument. Compact and well built, this starter instrument is a great introduction to the accordion--or just a lot of ephemeral fun. The accordion fits nicely into the palms of an adult's hands, but isn't too unwieldy for its target audience. The number of keys are minimized for ease of use and simplicity, but it's still possible to crank out a complex favorite such as "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (a brief "basic instructions" leaflet is enclosed) only 10 minutes after the instrument's out of the box.--Keith Simanton ;
