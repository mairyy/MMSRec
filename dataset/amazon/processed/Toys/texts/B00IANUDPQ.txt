Then use the scaffolding to rebuild the wall. And it's a job well done! This iconic starter set comes in a distinctive, reusable storage box and has instructions so that you can rebuild it into 2 new models. It's the ideal way to challenge your child's building skills and let them learn to build with LEGO bricks. It makes a great gift, too. Includes a construction worker minifigure. ;
