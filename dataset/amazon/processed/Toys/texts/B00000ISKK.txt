Title: Create-a-Scene Magnetic Playset: Construction Site ; Description: Tractors and dozers and backhoes, oh, my! Nothing beats a big dirt quarry with a whole slough of dirt-pushing, gravel-hauling trucks. Create endless combinations of scenes with a wide variety of vehicles and construction materials. Piles of dirt and rocks can be strategically placed, allowing the dump truck to come cart them away, or the bulldozer to push them to a more useful area. Perfect for taking everywhere. Kids will have hours of constructive, imaginative fun with these permanently magnetic pieces.--Emilie Coulter ;
