Title: Cranium Cadoo ; Description: Cranium Cadoo is the outrageously fun game designed especially for kids. With a variety of hilarious activities, Cadoo gets kids thinking, creating, giggling, and grinning as they try to get four tokens in a row to win. Can you sculpt a taco? Act out a hula dancer? Think of a word that means to bounce a basketball and to drip milk from your chin? Which is strongest for its size: an ant, a human, or a chimp? Whether kids love to act, puzzle, sketch, sculpt, or even crack secret codes, Cadoo has something for them. Two or more kids will have a blast playing Cadoo -- even grown-ups will love to play and show what they can do! Cranium Cadoo earned the 2002 Game of the Year award from the Toy Industry Association, the Platinum Best Toy Award -- the highest honor -- from the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio and the Parents' Choice Gold Award. For 2 or more players, ages 7 and up. ;
