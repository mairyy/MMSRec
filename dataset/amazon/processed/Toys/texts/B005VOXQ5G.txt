Title: Schleich Female Gorilla with Baby ; Description: Gorillas are the largest living representatives of the primate family. Despite their prominent canine teeth and muscular bodies, they feed almost exclusively on plants. The males are significantly larger than the females. The gorillas' habitat in the jungle of Central Africa is continuously being encroached upon due to human expansion. For this reason, there are only a small number of these animals, just as timid as they are fascinating, remaining. They are an endangered species. ;
