Title: Polly Pocket Cruise Ship ; Description: Even tiny dolls need some leisure time to chillax. Polly Pocket&#x92;s pals go for the ultimate in luxury recreation: a cruise ship for hip young things. Whether they&#x92;re parasailing or shopping, hot tubbing or rock climbing; Lila, Rick, and Lea are clearly having the time of their lives&#x97;as will the lucky kids who get to play with this elaborate cruise ship! Closed up tight, it&#x92;s a sleek, aerodynamic white, pink, and blue vessel. Open it up and wow! Party time. Lots of tiny little parts: lounge chairs, deck chairs, floats, beach balls, caf&#xE9; tables, wardrobes, suitcases, clothes and accessories, palm trees, tiki lamps, headphones, sunscreen bottles, and more. Then the equipment for activities: a super fast spiral slide that ends in a swimming pool. A rock-climbing wall. Hot tub (removable, so you can fill it with real water), hammock, elevator, caf&#xE9;, boutique&#x85;. The gang&#x92;s bathing suits change color when the water in the hot tub is switched out for cold! There&#x92;s even a So Hip Cruise Ship "board" (actually paper) game. And when everyone&#x92;s tuckered out for the day, they can head to the bedroom with fold-down beds. The only question is, why did Polly&#x92;s friends ditch her for this cruise? There&#x92;s no sign of the gal who makes it all happen, Miss Pocket herself. In other words, Polly Pocket is not included. But just about everything else under the tropical sun is.--Emilie Coulter ;
