Title: Kotobukiya DC Comics Justice League Batman New 52 ArtFX+ Statue ; Description: Joining his fellow Leaguers in their impressive lineup, Batman stands at the ready, no doubt contemplating multiple scenarios in his head. Wayne&#x2019;s first appearance in the ARTFX+ lineup captures his New 52 look by Jim Lee perfectly, with his current subtly-armored Bat suit. The details on Batman are exceptional from the intricate lines on his costume to the many tiny pouches on his utility belt, wicked bladed gauntlets, long flowing cape and more. Kotobukiya&#x2019;s unique take on this Batman features a metallic sheen to his gray costume that looks fantastic with the darker black of the cape, cowl, chest emblem, gloves and boots, while of course the belt is its traditional bright yellow. ;
