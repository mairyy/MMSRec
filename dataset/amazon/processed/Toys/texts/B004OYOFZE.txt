Title: Stomp Rocket Junior Glow Kit with Extra Jr. Glow Rocket Refills ; Description: Stomp on the Launch Pad and a blast of air propels the Stomp Rocket over 100 feet in the air! No battery or fuel is needed to get the rockets airborne--just some old-fashioned stomping power. Set up the simple launch stand in a clear outdoor area, connect the 38-inch-long vinyl air hose and blast pad, load one of the 9-inch yellow foam rockets--and watch out. The kit comes with 4 glow in the dark foam rockets. The Junior is designed for ages 3 and up. ;
