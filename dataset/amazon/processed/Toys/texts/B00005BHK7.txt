Title: LeapFrog Hug &amp; Learn Baby Tad Plush ; Description: Baby Tad is a wonderful interactive toy that makes early learning fun and  easy. Baby Tad (short for tadpole) helps your preschooler learn shapes, colors, activities,  and songs. When your little one presses a colored light-up button, Tad identifies the color  and shape indicated on the button. With his cheerful demeanor and infectious laugh, Tad  offers support and encouragement and will quickly become a close and trusted friend.  Besides various greetings,  a squeeze of Tad's hand brings forth favorite children's songs,   sung in a squeaky, high-pitched voice.--Alison Golder ;
