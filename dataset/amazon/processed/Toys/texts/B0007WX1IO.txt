Title: Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus:  Brietta the Pegasus with Light-up Crown ; Description: A beautiful winged steed for Barbie, the Brietta Pegasus figure has shimmering features so little dreamers can act out fabulous stories. Her soft pink body features glittery lavender hooves, real eyelashes, and long white and purple ringlets for her mane and tail. Her removable iridescent wings flutter softly as she flies through the air, and her legs are fully posable for realistic action. The horse also comes with other pieces that make playtime fun: a light-up crown, a necklace with bell, mane ornaments, and a clear saddle with a belt to hold Barbie on as she rides side-saddle. Based on the horse in theBarbie and the Magic of Pegasusmovie, Brietta stands approximately 10-1/2 inches high from her front hooves to the tip of her pretty ears.--Emily Bedard ;
