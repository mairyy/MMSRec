Title: LeapFrog Leapster Carrying Case ; Description: This durable case is designed for toting the popular Leapster around on car trips, plane rides, or anywhere kids might travel. It holds up to six Leapster cartridges in a rear pouch and has room for the Leapster itself in the main zippered compartment, which sports a soft fleece lining. The case is relatively lightweight and doesn't feature the hard shell that some might like for protecting the Leapster but the soft plastic covering should provide protection for most accidental knocking around.--Charlie Williams ;
