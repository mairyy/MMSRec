First, attach the sensor to your suspect&#x2019;s finger. Start off with some easy questions to get warmed up. Then, when they least expect it, jump in with the hard-hitting questions to really make &#x2018;em squirm. Watch the indicator lights &#x2013; they light up when your suspect isn&#x2019;t telling the truth. Busted. ;
