Title: Thomas &amp; Friends Wooden Railway - Water Tower ; Description: This miniature water tower is a simple, clever toy that is fun for any age. Attached to a small  platform and piece of track, it fits neatly into the Thomas the Train layout that your child has already  designed. A lever action pump "empties" and "fills" the see-through tower, so your child will have a real  sense of filling up the engine.Based on the award-winningShining Time Stationtelevision series, the Thomas the Tank Engine  train system fulfills all of a child's train-set dreams. Each 2-inch-high, wooden vehicle has black plastic  wheels and a different name, character, and face, and there are magnetic bumpers at the ends for easy  link-up. Your child will delight in making the pieces interact during imaginary play and will learn social  skills playing train with friends. Designed to keep pace with your child's development, this toy  encourages the use of new motor and cognitive skills. Other track pieces and accessories are available.--Sandy Hirsch ;
