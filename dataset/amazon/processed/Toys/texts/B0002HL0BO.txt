Title: Power Touch Baby Reading System ; Description: Welcome Baby to the brave new world of interactive books with this LeapPad-styled talking picture book system. As with regular books, grownups will want to introduce their tots to the concept, sitting together at first and pointing out pictures and words. Soon they can advance to the interactive part: touching words, objects, holes, icons, or textured spots on the pages to hear descriptive phrases, music, words identified, and fun sounds. More than 100 songs can be heard, and with the purchase of additional stories and cartridges, the opportunities for fun learning are endless. The Baby Animals book (included) is simple and colorful, with recognizable critters in their own settings. The system allows three modes to play: Story, Explore, and Surprise. Let Baby&#x92;s fingers do the exploring! Four AA batteries required (not included).--Emilie Coulter ;
