Title: Monster High Die-Ner and Draculaura Playset and Doll ; Description: Monster High Die-ner and Draculaura Playset and Doll: Who's hungry? Not one who enjoys classic food, Draculaura has opened a die-ner to offer a menu designed to please the ghouls of Monster High. Classic items include bat-winged tomato soup with grilled cheese, milkshakes and a "ghost" pie that sits boo-tifully on the cake stand. Hungry die-ners can fang out at the iCounter in a tombstone stool or on a bench at the coffin-shaped table. The spook-tacular decor features a counter with oven and grill behind it, dangling signage decorated with a Skullette detail, a clock on top of the counter and a mini-Tomb box (jukebox). The food is to die for - and to pay for, at the register before you go Boo appetite. ;
