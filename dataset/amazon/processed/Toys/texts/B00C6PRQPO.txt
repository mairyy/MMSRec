Title: Disney Frozen Magiclip Elsa Doll ; Description: This charming collection features adorable Anna and Elsa small dolls from the upcoming Disney feature Frozen. Anna and Elsa are sisters living in the enchanted Kingdom of Arendelle. Each has her own unique personality and style, though their elaborate wardrobes are reflective of their icy kingdom's trends. Each small doll, sold separately, wears a glittery signature fashion with tiara and comes with an additional ombre-colored gown inspired by the movie - both in easy-to-dress MagiClip form. Simply squeeze an outfit to put it on or take it off. With a second fashion, girls can have twice the fun and adventure. Anna looks pretty in a gown with a black bodice and a glittery blue skirt. A pink cape adds a striking (and sensibly warm) touch. Her second fashion showcases her spirited personality with bright reds and blues and a charming Norwegian rosemaling-inspired molded design. Anna's sister Elsa appears elegant in her shimmery blue and white gown with snowflake details on a molded overcoat. A second look in green and pink with a bigger pattern also delights. Girls will love reenacting the adventures of these two different sisters and imagining new ones. Each pack includes one small doll and two fashions. Each sold separately. Ages 3 and older. ;
