Title: Girder and Panel Hydrodynamic Deluxe Set ; Description: This set comes with a large tray and footing in which you build the structure. The tray measures approximately 10 inches by 16 inches by 3 inches deep. The tray and the footing are both white. The footing has a grid of 12 holes for columns (4 x 3 configuration). Build the structure using the footing in the tray for the base, place the submersible pump in the tray, add water until you completely cover the inlet on the pump, and then enjoy reconfiguring the pipes, opening and closing valves and watching the action! When you take the set down, all the parts pack into the tray, the plastic lid snaps on and it can be safely stored away for future use. ;
