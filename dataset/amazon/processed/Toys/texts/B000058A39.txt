Title: Fisher-Price Baby Playzone: Pull Up Ball Blast ; Description: There's lots to see, hear, and do with this toy that will  foster the developmental skills of a toddler. When little ones push one  of the five plastic balls through the hole at the top of this tower,  lights flash and music plays. From there the ball travels down a spiral  path all the way to the bottom--unless your toddler chooses to redirect  it with the dial on the side of the ramp. Some babies will simply enjoy  watching the ball swirl down the ramp. But as babies get a bit  older, they will also be able to observe and anticipate the action  of the balls and realize that their actions have an effect on  where the balls go. How cool is that? For a toddler, very cool! One  drawback to this toy is that it probably isn't sturdy enough or heavy  enough for babies or toddlers to use it to pull themselves from a  sitting to a standing position, though the "Pull-up" portion of the  name implies that's possible. There's plenty more to do with this toy,  so that is only a minor consideration. ;
