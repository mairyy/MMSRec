Title: Fisher Price - Laugh &amp; Learn&trade; Stride-to-Ride Learning Walker&trade; ; Description: This happy-looking car is a fun and versatile way to help younger children get up and get on the move. It&#x92;s actually only a toy car in terms of its front end which features a smiling face. Behind the steering wheel, however, it&#x92;s a basic ride-on, teaching young riders about cause and effect while improving their balance and gross motor skills. There&#x92;s a yellow bar across the top of the dashboard for kids who need a little extra help holding on, or for kids who want to forgo the seat entirely and use it as a walker, as well as a steering wheel for more skilled motorists. The car features twelve tunes, including three sing-a-long songs, along with a horn (a human voice saying "beep!"), shape sorting blocks, and a voice that announces whether the rider is steering left or right.--Charlie Williams ;
