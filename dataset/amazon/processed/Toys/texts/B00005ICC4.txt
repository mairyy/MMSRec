Title: Giant Building Block 40-piece Set ; Description: Little ones with a knack for building and creative play will be drawn to  these lightweight and durable cardboard building blocks. A staple item in many preschools, this set can spark endless imaginative play as children build  large, life-size structures. Builders practice mathematical skills as they add  the number of blocks stacked on top of each other, and the various-sized blocks  can facilitate a conceptual understanding of fractions. When kids are  developmentally ready, parents can encourage them to discover that one large red  block is the same size as two medium yellow blocks or four small blue blocks.  Made from 50 percent recycled cardboard, the blocks have a smooth, water-resistant coating that's easy to clean. These blocks won a Parents' Choice  Classic Award and a Dr. Toy Classic Award. One word of caution: Make sure  there's enough storage space to hold all 40 blocks once assembled.--Lauren  Bernard, mother and elementary school teacher ;
