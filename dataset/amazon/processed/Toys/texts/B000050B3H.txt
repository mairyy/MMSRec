Title: Dirt Devil Junior Lights Sounds Upright Toy Vacuum Cleaner ; Description: Little tykes who like to play pretend can clean the floors with  this scaled-down Dirt Devil vacuum. Standing 28 inches tall, it's a  lightweight plastic vacuum cleaner with a pivoting handle and wheels  that glide across any smooth surface. Push a button and the base lights  up, while the motor kicks in to make a revving sound. It takes three AA  batteries (included) to create the light and sound, but with or without  batteries, this is a likely hit amongst the tidy crowd.--Lauren  Bernard ;
