Title: Quattro Tour Stroller - Windsor ; Description: It can sometimes be a little bit tricky to find a stroller that is strong, durable, and spacious for long walks while also being lightweight and manageable enough to handle easily in a variety of settings. This solid touring stroller from Graco strikes a nice balance, featuring excellent mobility and handling in our informal test while also being well appointed with features like a spacious lower storage basket, one-hand collapsibility, and four-position recline in the 40-pound capacity seat. Other niceties include toy and cup holders for the passenger (no cup holders for you, Mom and Dad&#x97;sorry) and a combination clock and thermometer.--Charlie Williams ;
