Title: Original Gyroscope / Boxed ; Description: The gyroscope is such a simple idea that it's tempting for toy manufacturers to make them cheaply.  But the cheaply made ones usually don't have a dense flywheel or good bearings--and they don't work. The Chandler is a delightful exception: all-metal and precision made, it also comes with a simple instruction sheet that contains a number of tricks you probably wouldn't have thought of.  A great toy for children and physicists of all ages. Parental supervision will be necessary to avoid frustration for children under 6: these things don't work unless you get them to spin fast.--Richard Farr ;
