Title: Little Tikes Swing Along Castle ; Description: Castle Swing along Climber Building an actual castle can be awfully time consuming (just ask the medieval serfs). Fortunately this outdoor play set offers a nice alternative that&#x92;s probably a whole lot more fun anyway. Done up in reds and browns, it features a telescope (just a plastic tube but effective enough for a kid&#x92;s imagination), ship-style steering wheel, tunnels to climb through, a rock hill to climb up, and a slide to go down. There&#x92;s also a bucket swing with a three-point safety belt. Built more with smaller kids in mind, it would make a nice addition to the backyard and assembles fairly easily.--Charlie Williams ;
