Title: Wheels on the Bus Board Game ; Description: The Wheels on the Bus Game will probably drive adults 'round and 'round  the bend, with its all-talking, all-singing action, powered by three AA  batteries (not included). But designed for 3- to 6-year-olds, this combination  of memory game, play-acting, and sing-along fits nicely into Milton Bradley's  "My First Games" portfolio. Players take turns rolling the musical yellow bus to  their space on the board. Pressing the hood tells them which of the four tokens  (door, wiper, horn, or wheel) to locate by turning over any two of the 20 face- down tokens. Make a match, and keep the token; collect all four, and it's an  express ride to the winner's circle.--Tony Mason ;
