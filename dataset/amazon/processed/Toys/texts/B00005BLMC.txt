Title: Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Water Tower Figure 8 Set ; Description: Little conductors will have loads of fun with this high-quality figure-eight railroad set from Thomas & Friends. Made of wood, the track features an elevated bridge in the center and a water tower where Thomas can re-fuel; the "water" rises and falls with flicks of the spout. Sir Topham Hatt and a red cargo car keep Thomas company. Other items in the 25-piece set include a railroad-crossing sign, a stop sign, and a tree. The instructions clearly diagram how to assemble the track. The box has a handle and makes a good carrying case.--Andy Boynton ;
