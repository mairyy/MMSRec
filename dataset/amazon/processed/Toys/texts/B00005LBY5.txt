Title: Jinx Board Game ; Description: Combine the three-in-a row of tic-tac-toe, the coordinates of bingo, and  a touch of "baby needs new shoes" bones-rolling action and you get Jinx: pure,  unadulterated luck of the dice and a heck of a lot of fast-moving fun. Check  your strategy-making, trivia-knowing, hand-eye coordination at the door; with  this game it's less right/left brain and more right- and left-handedness as  players roll the dice to plot the position of tokens on the 6-by-6 grid. Line up  a trio of your tokens horizontally, vertically, or diagonally and you win the  round. Nice touches, equally as random, include the JINX! (the removal from the  board of all your pieces should you duplicate a previous roll) and the Sorry!- like dispatch of an opposing token when your dice roll directs you to a space  otherwise occupied. OK, so it won't win a Mensa award (mindless fun with rules  printed on a strip of paper rarely does), but just try stopping after only one  game of these hi-Jinx.--Tony Mason ;
