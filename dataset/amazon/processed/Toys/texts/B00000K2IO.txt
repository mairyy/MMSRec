Title: Make Your Own Opoly Board Game ; Description: Monopoly's popularity is of epic proportions. This  quintessential board game challenges wannabe capitalists of all ages to  accumulate as much wealth as possible by buying, selling, and trading  properties; collecting rents; and various other windfalls. Keeping  players engrossed for hours, Monopoly requires clever strategizing and  sometimes ruthless business maneuvers. Numerous versions of the  thoroughly satisfying game have appeared over the years, but  Make-Your-Own Opoly could be even better--because players create it themselves!  The game includes everything needed to hand-customize the game board,  cards, play money--even the box. Whether using a computer and printer  or simply a pen and scissors, anyone can manufacture the perfect  individualized "Smith-opoly," "Baldwin Middle School-opoly," or  "Timbuktu-opoly." Contains CD-ROM, floppy disk, paper and label set,  game board, six colored pawns, two dice, easy-to-follow publishing  booklet, and game instructions. For two to six players.--Emilie  Coulter ;
