Title: EZ-Peak NiCad / NiMH Charger with Traxxas Connector ; Description: The AC/DC EZ-Peak charger is designed for maximum simplicity and reliability. Just plug in a 6 to 8-cell pack, and the EZ-Peak begins charging at up to 4-amps&#x2014;no setup or programming required. Patented peak-detecting software makes certain the battery receives a full charge for maximum performance and run time you can count on. A status LED flashes red to indicate charging is in progress, then turns green when charging is complete. The EZ-Peak is equally at home on the bench with AC power, or in the field with a DC power source. A Traxxas High-Current Connector is installed for use with Traxxas Power Cell battery packs and other NiCad and NiMH packs with Traxxas connectors (Adapter #3062 required for use with Molex connectors, sold separately). EZ-Peak is built for years of reliable charging and is covered by the Traxxas Lifetime Electronics Warranty.
