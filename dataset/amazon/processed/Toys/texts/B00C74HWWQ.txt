Title: Disney Princess The Little Mermaid Castle Playset ; Description: Disney Princess The Little Mermaid Castle Playset: Experience both of Ariel's worlds -"under the sea" in her colorful mermaid grotto or above at Eric's royal palace. As a mermaid, Ariel can slide down her sparkly green slide, "swim" with Flounder to explore and store underwater treasures (including a statue of her beloved Prince Eric.), swing on her pink shell chair or lounge on her rock by the sea. Ariel can then slip into her shimmery easy-to-dress MagiClip princess gown and "dance" on the shore near the castle. With so many ways to play both above and below the sea, it's endless fun with every girl's favorite mermaid princess. ;
