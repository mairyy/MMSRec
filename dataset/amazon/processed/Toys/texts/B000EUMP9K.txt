Title: Radio Flyer Ultimate Family WagonTM ; Description: Radio Flyer wagons have sure come a long way since 1923, when the company's first simple wood wagon went on sale. The Ultimate Family Wagon is a roomy luxury vehicle with five different seating configurations, a separate storage area, safety belts, and an activity table -- just to name a few of its features. It also comes with a UV sun protection canopy, as well as an abundance of cup holders (two for the kids; two for the adults). Flip-up seats make for a comfortable ride for kids, but can also be folded  flat to haul stuff around. This wagon is big, so if you want a wagon you can take with you on family trips, check the measurements to make sure the Ultimate Family Wagon will fit in your car.Ultimate Family WagonAges:18 months+ ;
