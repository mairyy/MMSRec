Title: Hot Wheels Slimecano Playset ; Description: Those of us who spend a lot of time looking at, evaluating, and playing with toys often complain that they all start to look alike after a while. After all, a racetrack is a racetrack and a doll is a doll right? But once in a while, a toy comes along that really makes us sit up and take notice. In that vein, the Hot Wheels Slimecano is easily the weirdest toy we've seen in a long time. The idea is to power up your Hot Wheels car (none included) using a special charger at the base of a big brown mountain with a creepy snake face carved into it. Then while the mountain starts spewing slime, you race to the top, avoiding falling boulders and trying to successfully jump over a pit of goo. The mountain shakes periodically and plays five different sound effects. The Slimecano promises a lot of action and happily it's well-designed so everything works pretty well. Although we're not sure how much sustained play value the Slimecano will have over the course of months and years, it at least brings a unique and bizarre element to the racetrack category.--Charlie Williams ;
