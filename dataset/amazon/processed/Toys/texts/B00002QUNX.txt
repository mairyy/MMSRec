Title: Little Tikes Baby Tap A Tune Piano ; Description: Designed for very young children, this is a charming piano with  four large, easy-to-depress square keys in green, blue, red, and orange.  When the keys are played, the metal xylophone-style strips on top of the  piano produce sweet chiming sounds. This little piano will enchant your  child, teach basic colors, and demonstrate a few fundamentals of music.  Surprisingly, the notes are delightful even when played all at once--a  unique quality in a toy piano.--Sandy Hirsch ;
