Title: Triumph 5 Comfort Touch Convertible Car Seat with LATCH: Aristotle ; Description: Rated as one ofConsumer Reports&#x92;s top three car seats in 2005 for safety and ease of use, the Triumph 5 convertible car seat is a sound investment. The only car seat parents ever have to buy, this model starts out rear-facing for infants between 5 to 30 pounds and installs facing forward for toddlers from 20 to 40 pounds.The non-twisting 5-point harness is easy for parents to fasten and a visual verification on the buckle ensures it is secure. A tension knob on the side adjusts the lap belt while the upper straps are equipped with a feature called Memory Harness, which expands while strapping a child into the seat but then safely snaps back to the original tension. Periodic height adjustments to the harness system are easily done from the front of the seat without requiring it to be removed from the car and can be set to three different height positions.Five reclining positions angle the seat so toddlers can take a nap on the road comfortably without slumping forward. The extra-plush seat pad also cushions baby nicely and the subtle black and gray fabric cleans up easily.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
