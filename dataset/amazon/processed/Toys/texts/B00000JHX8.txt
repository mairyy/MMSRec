Title: Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Edward The Blue Engine ; Description: Edward is a cheerful blue worker train. Hauling coal, helping the big guys, hanging out in the train yard--this friendly fellow's goal in life is to be a really useful engine. This 3-inch sturdy wood engine and the accompanying 2-inch cargo car will surely get the job done every time. Based on the popularThomas the Tank Engineseries by Reverend W. Awdry and the PBS television showShining Time Station, the wooden railway system is compatible with other magnetic train sets. You can reenact all the exciting stories in the series or make up new ones. Thomas fans won't want to miss out on any of these fun, well-built railway characters.--Emilie Coulter ;
