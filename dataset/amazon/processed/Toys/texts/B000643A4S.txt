Title: Listen-Up Rounds ; Description: Curious babies (and what babyisn&#x92;tcurious?) will pursue these sense-stimulating balls high and low, day and night. Much like the popular Peek-A-Blocks, these balls are filled with jingling, clicking, rattling baubles that spring into (safely contained) action at baby&#x92;s slightest touch. The clear Listen-Up Rounds allow babies of all ages to enjoy the noisy objects inside each ball without any risk of harm from small, movable parts. The youngest infant will clutch and gnaw on the just-right-sized balls, while crawlers will chase them, bang them, toss them, hide them--in short, get creative! Within each ball are crashing cymbals, tumbling beads, or tiny bells. This set of six is destined to be a big favorite. By the way, baby will never forgive you if you don&#x92;t buy the other coordinating sets: Touch & Tickle Rounds and Look-a-Rounds. There&#x92;s got to be an extra IQ point or two in it for baby, right? (Ages 6 months to 2 years).--Emilie Coulter ;
