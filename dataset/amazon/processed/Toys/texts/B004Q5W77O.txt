Title: Cargo Noir ; Description: Cargo Noir is a game of illicit trading in which players run "families" who traffic in smuggled goods around the world. The successful smuggler will learn to dispatch&#xA0;his cargo ships to the safest or richest ports; accurately judge which contraband is the hottest; and outmaneuver his competitors with an ample supply of gold - pouncing when the time is right to take the cargo he wants.&#xA0;Cargo Noir is a rich and immersive atmosphere, filled with evocative illustrations of the dark and seedy smuggling world of the 1950's.&#xA0;You're the lead character in a classic film noir.&#xA0;&#xA0; Cargo Noir is quickly learned, but offers many routes to victory; and is the rare trading game that works equally well with 2 players or more. Cargo Noir contains: Game boards of Macao and 8 different ports; 131 Cargo tokens, 54 Victory cards; 5 "Family" game sheets; 25 sculpted Cargo ships; 60 gold coins; a Cargo Noir token bag; First Turn and Player markers and rules booklet. ;
