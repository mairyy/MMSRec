Title: Frog Juice ; Description: How would you create a magic spell? You might need some unicorn horn  or some eye of newt, or maybe some bats or toadstools or star and moon dust. But  be forewarned as you're stirring up your potion--you'd better be wary of a  black cat or the powerful All-Purpose Witch Wash! One of your opponents might  even be brewing up an Uglifying Spell. ("Results guaranteed to crack mirrors  at a single glance!") All of these magical ingredients are part of Frog Juice,  an imaginative card game for two to four players that uses fairy-tale elements from fair maids to frogs to  create a game that both kids and adults will enjoy. This game of strategy includes 44 ingredient cards and  15 power cards, each with an illustration that looks like it came straight out of a fairy-tale book. Cards are  played in the center of the game and then captured by other players by matching numerical values or by  using stronger powers.--Marcie Bovetz ;
