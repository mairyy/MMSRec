Title: Fisher-Price Musical Tea Set ; Description: Every child should have a tea set somewhere in the toy box, not just for  feeding favorite dollies and teddies, but also for practicing tea-party manners before a  special party or dinner. This molded plastic set is made with the thoughtful design and  extra-durable materials of most Fisher-Price toys, with the added bonus of a jolly musical  teapot. It plays "I'm a Little Teapot" when the top of the lid is pressed, and also provides  a "magical" chiming noise when the pot is poured (requires two button-cell batteries;  included). The set includes four teacups in pastel shades, matching saucers, a sugar bowl,  a creamer, and four white spoons. Everything fits onto a sturdy lavender tray with large  handles and a built-in stand for the teapot.--Marcie Bovetz ;
