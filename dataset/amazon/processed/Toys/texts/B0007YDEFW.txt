Title: Imaginext System: T-Rex Mountain with Exclusive Bonus ; Description: Dinosaurs are a common obsession among kids and this T-Rex Mountain playset takes children back to the Mesozoic Era for unlimited play in a prehistoric time. Per Fisher-Price&#x92;s storyline, there are two camps of dinosaurs and primitive humans who are battling with each other over land&#x97;the Predators, who are destroying all the natural resources, and the Ecovores, who are doing everything in their power to preserve the land. This multi-level playset is the headquarters for the Predators and has a variety of secret weapons to keep the Ecovores out. Kids can roll a falling boulder or knock a tree over onto intruders, or they can capture enemies underneath a claw trap with the press of a button. The best weapon of all is the button-activated T-Rex skull with red light-up eyes and roaring sounds that gulps down any caveman that dares get close to its mouth. T-Rex Mountain can be reconfigured each time kids play with it so the setup and adventure may never be the same. The set comes with T-Rex, caveman, and prehistoric bird figures and, as a special bonus, includes three additional dinosaurs and two cavemen with clubs. Three "AAA" batteries are included to power the sound effects.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
