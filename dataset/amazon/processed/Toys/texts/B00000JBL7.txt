Title: Melissa &amp; Doug Magnetic Fishing Game ; Description: A plywood puzzle with a difference: the idea is to get the pieces out after you put them in. The  11.75-inch by 8.50-inch aquatic scene (mainly in blues, oranges, and browns) includes such pieces as a sea horse,  various fish, a crab, and a starfish. Though the pieces are wood, each has a metal "button" in the middle;  attach a magnet to a line and practice "fishing" them out before reconstructing the puzzle. (For an  especially interesting challenge, try "fishing" them back in.)--Richard Farr ;
