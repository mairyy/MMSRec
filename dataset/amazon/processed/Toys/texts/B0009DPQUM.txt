Title: Crayola Magnetic Double-Sided Easel ; Description: With two work surfaces and four ways to create, the Crayola Double Easel is ready to turn any inspiration into a work of art. On one side, a combination magnetic/dry erase board captures your little one&#x92;s multimedia work, with the help of 77 magnetic letters and numbers (included). On the other side, a chalkboard awaits a good dusting up. Both sides have clips to slip paper beneath so old fashion painting can take place. Four removable bins easily store art supplies, magnets, an eraser--anything a budding artist needs to keep at the ready. Made of sturdy plastic and standing 43 inches tall, the easel easily accommodates two artists and is quick to assemble: simply snap the arm braces (shaped like red crayola crayons) onto plastic pegs, and the easel is ready to go. Lift the arms, and the easel folds flat for compact storage. Chalk and dry erase markers are not included.--Heather Lyndon ;
