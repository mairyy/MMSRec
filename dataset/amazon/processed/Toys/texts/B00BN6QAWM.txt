Title: Green Toys Shape Sorter Baby Toy ; Description: The My First Green Toys Shape Sorter puts an eco-friendly spin on a classic play pattern. Made in the USA from food-safe, 100% recycled plastic milk jugs that save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Shape Sorter helps develop recognition of shapes and colors while also encouraging eye-hand coordination, problem solving and fine and gross motor skill development. The two-part elliptical Shape Sorter and 8 colorful shapes (2 stars, 2 circles, 2 squares, 2 triangles) are the perfect size and weight for little hands. Each piece slides easily into the chute cut-outs on both the top and bottom of the Sorter, which opens with a simple twist, separating the two halves and letting the pieces out again. No BPA, phthalates, PVC or external coatings and also meets FDA food contact standards. Dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. Packaged with recycled and recyclable materials and printed with soy inks. Recommended for ages 6 months and up. Dimensions: Sorter: 8" diameter; Shapes approximately 1.5"H. ;
