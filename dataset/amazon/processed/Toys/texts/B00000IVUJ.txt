Title: Galt Toys Marble Run Toy Set ; Description: Six chutes, plus six curves, plus nine tubes, plus three bases, plus six marbles equals a plethora of architectural possibilities. Galt's Marble Run is a sturdy, simply-put-together set in primary colors that's perfect for the beginning builder. Kids love to watch the marbles roll down the chutes, disappear into the tubes, and reappear on the curves a few inches lower. Since it can be configured any number of ways, it's a great discovery and exploration tool, providing instant feedback in the cause-and-effect department. And it's easy to take it apart and start over, too!--Julie Ubben ;
