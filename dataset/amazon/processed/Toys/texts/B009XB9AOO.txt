Title: Robinson Crusoe Adventures on the Cursed Island Board Game ; Description: Robinson Crusoe: Adventure on the Cursed Island is another epic game created by Ignacy Trzewiczek, the author of Stronghold. This time Trzewiczek takes the players to a deserted island, where they'll play the parts of shipwreck survivors confronted by an extraordinary adventure. They'll be faced with the challenges of building a shelter, finding food, fighting wild beasts, and protecting themselves from weather changes. Building walls around their homes, animal domestication, constructing weapons and tools from what they find and much more awaits them on the island. The players decide in which direction the game will unfold and &#x2013; after several in-game weeks of hard work &#x2013; how their settlement will look. Will they manage to discover the secret of the island in the meantime? Will they find a pirate treasure, or an abandoned village? Will they discover an underground city or a cursed temple at the bottom of a volcano? Answers to these questions lie in hundreds of event cards and hundreds of object and structure cards that can be used during the game...  Robinson Crusoe: Adventure on the Cursed Island is not only a thrilling story perfectly combined with its game mechanisms; it's also designed to change the co-operative genre by doing away with the major nuisances of cooperative games: the "leader issue" and the "dumb player issue". It's a cooperative game in which the problem of a single player deciding for the rest of the participants does not exist, the game that reacts in an exciting way to all of the players' actions. ;
