Title: Ouija Board Glow-in-the-Dark ; Description: If you've seen "The Exorcist" lately, the folks at Parker Brothers  would like to extend a heartfelt "Captain Howdy-Ya-Do?" courtesy of their  newly luminescent classic Ouija Board equipment. It's the same traditional  setup as it was decades ago: the alphabet-and-numbers board with "Yes," "No,"  and "Good Bye" spelled out in turn-of-the-century mysterious script; the  heart-shaped "Message Indicator Oracle" with the readout window; the numerous  coy references to Ouija being "only a game--isn't it?" So if this edition  seems to comprise a bit more plastic than we remember, the promise of the  board and indicator glowing in the dark for half-an-hour (after exposure to  lamplight for 10 minutes) more than makes up for it. Of course, in the dark  you'll never know for sure whether the person across the board is the one  pushing the indicator, now will you?--Tony Mason ;
