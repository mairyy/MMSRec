Title: Schleich Giant Turtle ; Description: A tortoise can live in a group or on its own; but, in either case, these reptiles rest during the day after searching for food in the morning. For meals, they like to eat worms and plants. Although stereotyped to be slow and careful, they are known for being swift when tempted by a treat, being skillful swimmers and even reaching too far by standing on their hind legs, falling back on their shell. Tortoises have an excellent defense against predators and danger as they can tuck themselves into their carapace. ;
