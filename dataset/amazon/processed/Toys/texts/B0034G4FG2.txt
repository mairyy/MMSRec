Galaxy Pegasus is the successor to Storm Pegasus 105RF and has evolved into next form, Big Bang Pegasus F:D. It is the third Pegasus in the Pegasus Timeline, coming after Pegasus 105F and Storm Pegasus 105RF. Galaxy Pegasus was known as "The Legendary Bey", as it was one of the prototypes of its predecessor Storm Pegasus 105RF and was the basis for it as well. However, it was sealed away, due to its uncontrollable power. Gingka would then obtain Galaxy Pegasus through a rock as Pegasus knew Gingka was the only Blader worthy of owning it. Gingka would use Galaxy Pegasus throughout the "Beyblade World Championship" and was eventually crowned the "Number 1 Blader in the World". However in Metal Fury, Galaxy Pegasus would then be hit by a piece of the Star Fragment while being serviced by Madoka and would evolve to become the more powerful, Big Bang Pegasus F:D. ;
