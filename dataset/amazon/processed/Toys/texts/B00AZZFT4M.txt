Title: Swish Junior Card Game ; Description: Swish Jr. is an adaptation of the wildly popular Swish for younger players. A Swish is made when two cards (or more) are stacked on top of each other so that the solid shapes fill in the matching shape and color outlines. In order to make a Swish, the cards may be rotated and flipped, but must lay on top of each other in the same direction so that the blue borders on the cards line up. Swish Jr. is loads of fun and develops visual and spatial thinking skills. Learn to move the cards in your mind and you'll be an expert at making Swishes. ;
