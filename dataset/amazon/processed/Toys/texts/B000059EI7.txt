Title: Magic Doorbell Playhouse ; Description: Anyone home? With the Magic Doorbell Playhouse, new friends can  announce their arrival by leaning on the electric doorbell. (Requires  three AAA batteries, not included.) Once through the red half-door,  they'll find a cozy play space that has all the comforts of home,  including a kitchen corner with stove, microwave, and cordless phone.  Forty-four inches high internally, the house has a pleasing blue "tile"  roof and tan exterior walls that are half "masonry," half "board," as  well as a lot of nice touches, like a pointed blue lintel over the  front door. The all-plastic exterior measures 48 by 32 inches; adult  assembly is required, but it snaps together quickly and easily.--Richard Farr ;
