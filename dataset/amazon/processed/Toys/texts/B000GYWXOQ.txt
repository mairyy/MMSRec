Title: WEDGiTS Expansion Combo Set ; Description: Kids have no limits to their creative direction especially with WEDGiTS eXPANsion parts that allow them to create human-like creatures and innovative structures. The eXPANsion Combo set adds a new dimension to WEDGITS creations.  Typically called eXPANders, each set comes with two black and two silver expansion parts, (11" and 12.5" in length, respectively).  They integrate the small and medium sized rhombus shapes found in the WEDGITS Junior and Deluxe products.  They have the appearance of magical wands and literally can link WEDGITS parts into super structures.  Designs take on whole new architectural directions from bridges, buildings, space station, animated creatures with arms and legs.  Each eXPANsion set includes design idea sheets with examples built around either the Junior, Delulxe or eXplorer Pak-125 product. ;
