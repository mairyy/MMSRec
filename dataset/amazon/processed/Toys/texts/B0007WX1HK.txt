Title: My Scene Goes Hollywood: Doll and Limo ; Description: A prop to go with the plot of the DVD movieMy Scene Goes to Hollywood, this purple stretch SUV limo ensures that the My Scene dolls have stylin&#x92; transportation to their first movie premiere after they are cast as extras in a glamorous Hollywood movie. The side doors on this party pad on wheels open up to a roomy and glitzy compartment that fits all four My Scene gang members. Two plush corner banquettes provide cozy seating while a center bar holds beverages and snacks and also hosts a TV set for high-tech entertainment during the ride. A disco ball in the ceiling, blue mood lighting along seat edges, and white backlighting in the bar and floor liven up this limousine with the atmosphere of a nightclub. And, for the ultimate luxury, the dolls can lounge in the real working hot tub at the back of the limo or pop the top off to wave to fans and the paparazzi. This accessory coordinates with four dolls made specifically for the My Scene Goes Hollywood collection.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
