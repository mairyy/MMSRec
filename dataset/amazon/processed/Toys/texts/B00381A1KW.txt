Title: Chuggington StackTrack Zephie ; Description: Zephie is a young scissor-lift trolley, big enough to carry two people to work sites or destinations that need special attention. Unlike the other chuggers, she can spin around and scissor up and down in excitement.  She is flighty, giggly, girly and fun. Chuggington is her playground and she is always fascinated and excited about the wonders found there. Although she likes to have fun, she knows when it's time to get to work, too!  Zephie's cab rises and rotates just like on the show!  Enjoy the action-packed train play with Chuggington Die-Cast!
