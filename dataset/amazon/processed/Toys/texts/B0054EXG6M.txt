Title: Small World Underground ; Description: Small World Underground is a stand-alone game set beneath the surface of the same fun, light-hearted Small World universe of epic conquests and fallen empires. Featuring new Races and Special Powers, it also introduces a new twist to the original game play - Monster occupied regions that protect Relics and Places of great power. While more daunting to conquer, these bestow even greater powers to their owner. Like previous Small World expansions which sold out quickly, this sequel to the best-selling Small World board game (over 100,000 sold world wide) is sure to be a hit with fans. Small World Underground can be played on its own or combined with other Small World game elements, as many of the Races and Sepcial Powers from the original game and previous expansions are compatible. Recommended for experienced Small World players, the game includes: 2 double-Sided Game Boards, 15 New Fantasy Races with matching banners and tokens, 21 New Special Power badges, 9 Popular Places and 6 Righteous Relics, 106 Victory Coins, dozens of additional special tokens, 5 Player and 1 Game Turn Summary Sheets, 1 Reinforcement Die, and Rules Booklet. ;
