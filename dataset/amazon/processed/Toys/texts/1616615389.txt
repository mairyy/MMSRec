Title: Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars X-Wing: TIE Interceptor Expansion Pack ; Description: Imperial players can add a lethal new star fighter to their X-Wing squadrons with the TIE Interceptor Expansion Pack. The finest mass-produced star fighter of its time, the TIE interceptor excels at dogfighting thanks to its heightened maneuverability, increased speed, and four wing-mounted laser cannons that easily allow it to outgun its predecessors. The TIE interceptor brings more to the table, though, than just its armaments. It features six skillful new pilots, including the renowned Imperial ace, Soontir Fel. The star fighter's "Boost" action affords tremendous tactical freedom, and the pack&#x2019;s daredevil pilots can wrench maneuvers out of the ship that its designers at Sienar Fleet Systems may have never imagined. With its detailed miniature, two upgrades, and new pilots, the TIE Interceptor Expansion Pack creates exciting opportunities for all Imperial players. ;
