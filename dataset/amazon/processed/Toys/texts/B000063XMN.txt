Title: SpongeBob SquarePants Sno Cone Maker ; Description: Through the years, the concept of the toy sno-cone maker has not changed much. You put the ice in the top, turn a handle for a while, and the ice comes out the bottom. You add a sort of flavored syrup, and then you eat it. That simple. No batteries, just fun. Making it more fun, of course, is the fact that SpongeBob SquarePants, the star of the wildly popular cartoon series is involved. On this set, SpongeBob is huge and his big dumb smile makes him an entertaining addition to any countertop. But wait, you say, how could SpongeBob have sno cones when he lives under the sea? Wouldn't all that water cause the ice to melt? Or at the very least float away? Shhh. Don't worry about that. Have a sno cone.--John Moe ;
