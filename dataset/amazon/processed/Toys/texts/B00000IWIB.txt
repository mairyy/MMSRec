Title: Lucky Ducks ; Description: Lucky Ducks is a sound-and-motion version of the typical color-matching game. An adult will need about 15 minutes to prepare the game (installing batteries, labeling ducks, and punching out cardboard nests), and then it's time to start selecting lucky duckies. A quacking sound effect is heard as the motorized board moves the 12 ducks around the pond. The first player to pick three ducks with colored stickers, which match the color of their nest, is the winner. The game has a couple of drawbacks: there is no volume control, so kids must figure out where their ducks are by watching the previous player replace them on the pond, and there are no game variations.--Pam Lauer ;
