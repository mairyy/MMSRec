Title: Munchkin Deluxe ; Description: 168 cards, 6 pawns, 6 player cards, game board, rules, and die. What makes this edition "deluxe"? It's got a big game board to keep your cards in place, and six colored pawns that you move on the game board as you level up. Plus a card to go with each pawn, to make it easy to remember who is what color and whose sex has changed. Go down in the dungeon. Kill everything you meet. Backstab your friends and steal their stuff. Grab the treasure and run. Admit it. You love it.Munchkin is the mega-hit card game about dungeon adventure . . . with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items. Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm . . . or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon . . .And it's illustrated (in full color) by John Kovalic. Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff. ;
