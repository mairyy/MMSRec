Title: Disney Planes Propwash Junction Airport Playset ; Description: Disney Planes Propwash Junction Airport Playset: Disney/Pixar's CARS takes place on the ground, but what's going on in the skies above them? A whole new incredible world of extreme speed, adventure and fun! All is revealed in PLANES, the new movie with a new daredevil star &#x2013; Dusty Crophopper, who's included in this thrill-seeking playset that re-creates his hometown from the film. No airport would be complete without a runway, and the Propwash Junction playset has a special one. It's a translucent slide that wraps around the airport's control tower. Drop Dusty onto it, and you can send him on a tower fly-by on his way back down to the ground. The Dusty Crophopper vehicle has a connector on its belly that hooks up to the propeller on top of the fueling station part of the playset. A little push allows the plane to circle Propwash Junction. Dusty can also "refuel" at the gas station, or roll to the hangar and rest for the night. ;
