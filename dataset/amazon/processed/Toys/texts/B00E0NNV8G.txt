Title: Mirari Pop! Pop! Piano Toy ; Description: Giving children stimulating, quality toys at a young age provides them with the tools they need to grow, thrive and learn. Through play, children explore their world and experience wonder and fulfillment, opening a world of possibilities. Knowing this, we created a line of preschool toys named Mirari, from the Latin word "wonder". Our toys embody classic play in an innovative way, without any unnecessary or overwhelming features, to entertain and engage children. Play should be pure in its experience, without added features that merely distract and detract from the magic of play. The Mirari brand of toys embraces this, bringing joy to children and families, because we believe that a world of wonder begins with playful discoveries. ;
