Title: LEGO Architecture Robie House 21010 ; Description: Completed in 1910, Frederick C. Robie House in Chicago's affluent Hyde Park neighborhood is considered to be Frank Lloyd Wright's most accomplished Prairie-style work. This style is acknowledged as the first truly American style, and is characterized by dominating horizontal lines, banded rows of windows and spacious, open floor plans. F.C. Robie commissioned Wright to design a home that would provide beautiful vistas of the surrounding neighborhood, while maintaining privacy for his family. The final 9,062-square-foot design met the brief perfectly, combining a large window space to give an abundance of light, impressive views of the park and flowing interior spaces. This LEGO Architecture series interpretation of Robie House was designed by US architect Adam Reed Tucker in collaboration with the LEGO design team. ;
