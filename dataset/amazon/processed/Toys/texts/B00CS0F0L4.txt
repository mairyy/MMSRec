Title: Nerf Rebelle Power Pair Pack ; Description: Who says you and your BFF can't launch a stylish sneak blaster attack? Arm yourself and a friend with the 2 blasters in the Power Pair pack. Each of these stealth compact blasters can fit in a pocket or purse and launches darts at your targets. Load a dart and pull down the handle, then pull the trigger for a sassy strike. You can give one to a friend or launch a 2-fisted attack, but either way you're armed for action with the Power Pair pack. ;
