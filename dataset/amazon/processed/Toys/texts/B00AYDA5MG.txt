Title: Rio Grande Games Galaxy Trucker Anniversary Edition Board Game ; Description: Space... The final frontier. The biggest freeway to roam and make a quick buck! It has been five years since Corporation Incorporated started its new and progressive policy to deliver goods and construction materials to the struggling outer rim colonies. During that time, an army of eccentrics and roughnecks joined the ranks of brave truckers and trekked to the farthest reaches of the galaxy in ramshackle spaceships of their own construction. Planets have been explored, space stations looted and ships have crashed. It is time to celebrate! Not because celebration expenses are tax deductible, it's because Corporation Incorporated cares. The Anniversary Edition is the ultimate Galaxy Trucker experience. From the classic Galaxy Trucker through both Big Expansions, it contains everything we have released so far and some goodies to top it off. In a single big box you will get all the tiles, cards, spaceship schematics, tokens, rules and figures you and your friends will need for the greatest Galaxy Trucker game. ;
