Title: Chicco Flip 'n Play Table ; Description: Variety is the spice of life, especially for toddlers. The Flip 'n Play table answers the call. It comes with a two-sided insert and stands 13 inches off the ground. The table's strong point is its vast array of features: a miniature rotary phone, a small flipbook of circus animals, three each insert number and letter shapes, a jingling flip handle, a clock with spinning hands, and a mobile of colorful, spinning "balls within balls." But that's not all. A lever easily activates a circular train track with attachable train. A button next to the lever sets off an authentic train sound. Flip the entire insert over and you have a building table for blocks of squares, circles, rectangles, pyramids, and cat and dog heads (all included). Your child can build a multiplicity of configurations. For even more fun, add to this play center from a wide range of available accessories.--Sandy Hirsch ;
