Title: Learning Resources Skeleton Floor Puzzle ; Description: The foot bone&#x92;s connected to the leg bone, the leg bone&#x92;s connected to the knee bone &#x85;what&#x92;s the knee bone connected to? Kids will have no trouble working out where all of their bones fit together when they practice putting them in place on this life-size skeleton floor puzzle. The skeleton is 4 feet, 3 inches tall, from skull to toe, making him more enticing to build since he&#x92;s the same size as the average 6-year-old. All 15 pieces are made of soft durable foam so they have no sharp edges and won&#x92;t bend. The back of each piece is marked with the proper name for each bone to reinforce classroom units on the human skeletal system.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
