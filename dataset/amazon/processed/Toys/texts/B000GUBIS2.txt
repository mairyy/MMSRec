Title: Green Plasmacar ; Description: It's like magic, but you don't need to be a magician to get it to work. The PlasmaCar is a mechanical marvel that makes use of that most inexhaustible of energy sources, kid-power, by harnessing the natural forces of inertia, centrifugal force, gravity, and friction. It's so easy to operate; all it needs is a driver and a smooth, flat surface.  The PlasmaCar is adult-friendly, too. For starters, it doesn't require an expensive power source that needs constant replacement. No batteries, no power-cells, no liquid fuel-just the occasional cookie or two. It's quiet too-the only sound you'll hear is the sound of its wheels. It provides kids with plenty of exercise, more so than most toys. And the PlasmaCar is engineered to be absolutely safe when used appropriately. It's been extensively tested, and meets or exceeds all significant international safety standards.&#xBF; Fully Assembled: 31" x&#xBF; 14" x 16"&#xBF;&#xBF;&#xBF;&#xBF; 8.15 lbs ;
