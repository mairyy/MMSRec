Title: Geo Trax Working Town Railway System with exclusive bonus ; Description: This 30-piece train set makes for a nice introduction to the ever-fascinating world of toy trains. Young engineers can either push the three-car train along the track or use the included remote control to guide it. Two "factory sites", a windmill and a factory, let the train be powered automatically after the flip of a switch. We liked how, despite the set&#x92;s simplicity, there is some adaptability to the track, letting creativity enter into the fun.  With the exclusive bonus set, you also get an additional water tower, steam engine, and brown train car.--Charlie Williams ;
