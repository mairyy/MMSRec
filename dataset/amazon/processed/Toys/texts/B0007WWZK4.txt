Title: Fisher-Price&reg; Roll-a-Rounds&trade; Drop &amp; Roar&trade; Dinosaur ; Description: Yes, dinosaurs have been extinct for millions of years. But that probably won&#x92;t bother curious babies and toddlers who will delight playing with this friendly green guy. Four balls are included to roll through various openings and watch come out of other openings, teaching cause and effect while delighting curious young minds at the same time. The dinosaur has a bumpy tail and a mouth that can be made to open and shut. Ten different tunes accompany the action along with gently flashing lights and fun sound effects while a wiggly ladybug and a wiggly fish bounce along on top. The design of having the dinosaur lie flat while your little one crawls around investigating will also likely be good for motor skill development.--Charlie Williams ;
