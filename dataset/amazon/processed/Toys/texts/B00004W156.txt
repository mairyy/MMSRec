Title: Small World Living Toys Country Club Sandwich ; Description: With this pretend-food set there won't be any need for mud pies,  leaf-and-pebble casseroles, and other outmoded play-food creations. With  21 pieces of realistic looking plastic food and grocery items,  "Playmoms" and "Playdads" have the stuff to play house 21st-century  style. The food pieces fasten together with hook-and-loop fabric to  create sandwiches that'll last through the longest fake-food fight. The  sandwiches even tear apart with an amusing ripping noise. The set  contains plastic lettuce, cheese, meat slices, tomatoes, cucumbers (two  pieces of each), one can of tuna with a fake pop-top lid, a margarine  container, a play-safe plastic knife, and a loaf of bread with eight  slices.--Ava Natov ;
