Title: Driving Around Town Foldable Play Mat 60&quot; x 48&quot; ; Description: Imaginations will get lost in this town making it easy to have hours of creative play! Rocket Bug Toys paid close attention to how children play with their cars and, as a result, the town and road are set up accordingly. This phthalate-free vinyl mat was created as an alternative to bulky carpets that cannot be folded and stored away. It lays flat when unfolded and is very durable - enough for kids to play on top of without bunching or creasing! All with no batteries! Please note that this is NOT carpet material, but flexible, foldable material. For Ages 3 and up. ;
