Title: Rook ; Description: With its numbered deck of 57 cards, Rook, the classic card game, has elements of everything: bridge, pinochle, and lots of trumping and trick-taking. Includes two "black bird" cards that can change the course of any match. This basic set gives you all you need to get started: the deck and the rules. Great for learning strategy and patience.--Tom Keogh ;
