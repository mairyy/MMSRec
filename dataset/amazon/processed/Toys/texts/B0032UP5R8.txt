Title: ThinkFun Knot So Fast ; Description: This innovative new game tests who can tie a series of knots the fastest. Be the first player or team to finish tying the knot shown on one of 40 challenge cards, call out "Knot So Fast.", then move the Tug-O-War Rope one notch forward. When the Tug-O-War Rope slides all the way to one side, that player or team wins. While knot tying is a great skill to master at any age, it especially helps spatial development and manual dexterity in younger players. Play solo and practice for the next head-to-head match up. Ages 8 to adult. ;
