Title: Schleich Parasaurolophus ; Description: Schleich's Parasaurolophus is the perfect size for playing, Almost 13 metres long, the Parasaurolophus weighed 2 tons. This dinosaur with its long bony crest on its head and rounded beak was a curious sight. The ridge may have served 3 purposes: one: to produce a distinct call, two: to improve his sense of smell and three: to attract a mate. With its toothless beak, it probably grazed on tree leaves. ;
