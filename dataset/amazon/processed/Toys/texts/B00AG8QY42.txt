Easter Egg Hunts have never been like this. These magical eggs really hatch! Once found, simply place them in water and within 24 hours, they will start to crack. Soon thereafter will pop out a special growing pet. A Baby Chick, Duck, or Rabbit will delight your young one and make for a very special pet they can treasure year round. Brand New for 2013 and an Amazon.com Exclusive.

DIRECTIONS FOR USE:

Place Eggs in water. Within 24 hours your egg will begin to crack. Each day, replace water. The pet will continue to grow, out of its shell. You may help the pet out, but it will keep growing up to 10x its size with or without your help.

When the pet hatches, rinse the pet off as it will be slippery, and either play with it, or place it back in clean water and watch it daily continue to grow. ;
