Title: Chupacabra: Survive The Night ; Description: Turn out the lights and try to be the last mammal standing in this survival dice game based on Latin American folklore. Each player takes six dice and rolls them. If you roll a chupacabra you can take out your opponents&#x2019; chickens, goats and ox. Players take turns removing opponents&#x2019; animals from their hands based on how many chupacabras are rolled. Be the first to collect all dice in play but watch out for "Chupacabra Loco" when someone rolls all chupacabras and has the power to take out the largest pack of animals in play. The best part - Everything glows in the dark. Can you survive the night? ;
