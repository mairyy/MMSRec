Title: Easy Bake Bundle - Oven and Mixes ; Description: The Easy-Bake Oven has been a coveted possession since its creation,  because no other toy offers the promise ofrealdo-it-yourself treats,  along with the fun of actual cooking. (This model, by the way, looks more like a  microwave oven than a conventional one, but it works just as well as older  versions.) Just slide in the batter and, a few minutes later, slide out a yummy  pastry. A view window allows kids to watch all the baking action. When the  included mixes are devoured, parents can either purchase more or supervise the  use of other ingredients that can be baked, melted, or warmed--like regular cake  and cookie mixes, nacho cheese, or chocolate.This kit includes a functioning,  plug-in Easy-Bake oven; three mixes (one cake, one chocolate chip cookie, and  one sugar cookie); one package of chocolate frosting mix; two aluminum baking  pans; two cooking utensils; and a recipe booklet. There are also two warming  covers, two warming cups for snacks, and a plastic pan pusher to protect little  hands from the oven's electrical heat. This kit contains items that may choke  children 3 years and under.--Diane Beall ;
