Title: Last Night on Earth: Timber Peak Expansion ; Description: Escaping from the zombie-overrun town of Woodinvale, a handful of survivors make their way up into the mountains - but as they reach the small logging and mining town of Timber Peak, they discover that a new nightmare has just begun. Last Night on Earth: Timber Peak is an action-packed standalone game as well as an expansion for Last Night on Earth. Introducing the brand new town of Timber Peak with a full set of game boards, six new Heroes (including three Survivor versions of Heroes from the original Last Night on Earth), four Generator objective pieces, a full set of 14 Zombies, a host of new Scenarios, rules for fire breaking out and spreading, over 130 new game cards, and a full Experience System for both Heroes and the Zombie horde to gain upgrades within the course of each game. Timber Peak is packed with new material for veteran players to add to their toolbox, and a fantastic way for new players to jump into the action. A modular board randomly determines the layout of the town at the start of each game and there are several different scenarios to play, adding lots of replay ability. As with the original game, one or two players control the zombies, while the rest control heroes. To achieve a horror movie feel, all of the art for the game is photographic. ;
