Title: HABA Cordoba Building Blocks (Beechwood) ; Description: HABA Cordoba Building blocks set are wooden blocks still made in HABA&#x2019;s family owned factories in Bavaria Germany.  HABA uses only PEFC certified beechwood timbers (to ensure more trees are being planted than harvested).  HABA then uses a safe, water based, non-toxic stain color to penetrate and enhance the wood grain.  The colors and various shapes and materials in these blocks will stimulate a child&#x2019;s inventive creativity and may even inspire the adults! The base dimension of the blocks is 4cm approx. 2 inches and they can be combined with all the other HABA building blocks. ;
