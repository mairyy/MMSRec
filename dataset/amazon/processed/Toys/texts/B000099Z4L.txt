Title: LeapFrog Learning Friend&trade; Lily ; Description: Leap Frog's Learning Friend Lily is a giddy, green introduction to English, Spanish, numbers, counting, and colors for kids between 1 and 5 years. Lily uses visual learning aids--there are numbers on her colorful outfit, and in the fabric book attached to her hand--and inviting songs to go through each word, numeral and color in her repertoire. The learning songs are original and catchy, so kids will readily remember them, and can listen with each press of Lily's foot. They can activate her by hugging her soft body, too, as she teaches kids the role of a smart, cuddly friend. Required: 3 AAA batteries.Diane Beall ;
