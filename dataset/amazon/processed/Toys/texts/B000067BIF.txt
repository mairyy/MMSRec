Title: Melissa &amp; Doug Fold &amp; Go Barn ; Description: Old MacDonald could only wish for a farm like this! Cheerfully colored in bright red and sky blue, the Fold and Go Barn opens up to reveal a rustic barn with sliding doors, large stalls, stable doors and a hayloft. Little ones will delight in moving the horse, cow, sheep, goat, pig, dog and turkey in and out of stalls and around the barnyard. When playtime is over, just stash the animals inside the barn, fold and store. A convenient carrying handle makes this a must-have toy for families on the go. ;
