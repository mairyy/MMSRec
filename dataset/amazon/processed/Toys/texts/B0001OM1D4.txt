Title: Fisher-Price: Doodle Pro - Blue ; Description: Doodle Pro is not as challenging as its predecessor-sketcher, but it's just as intriguing for younger kids, who will ponder the mystery of the sketching surface just the same. Unlike with the trusty Etch-a-Sketch, kids who are just developing spatial and coordination skills don't have to worry about an increasingly complex, unbroken line of metallic dust, and there are no knobs to contend with. That's all too tricky: they just want to draw! To that end, there's a fat, easy-grip stylus with a magnetic tip, and four magnet stampers stored in a pull-out drawer. When the molded forms are pressed on the 10.5 by 7.5-inch doodling surface, shapes are created. And, instead of shaking (again, exertion), there's a sliding eraser for starting over instantly. Because there's no mess, and only a few loose pieces, it's also great for travel.--Diane Beall ;
