Title: Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Thomas the Tank Engine ; Description: Thomas the Tank is the signature bright-blue engine in the Thomas the Tank series. He does light yard work and pulls small passenger cars, such as Annie and Clarabel. Based on the award-winning television seriesShining Time Stationby the Reverend W. Awdry, the Thomas the Tank train system fulfills all of a child's choo-choo dreams. Each vehicle has a different name, character, and face. It is wooden and 2 inches high with black plastic wheels. The magnetic bumpers at the ends of each vehicle make linkup easy. Children will become friends with each one, developing not only imaginative play but social skills and new motor and cognitive skills as they mature.--Sandy Hirsch ;
