Title: Time Out Pad - Blue ; Description: The Time Out Pad is a pressure sensitive pad with a built in timer that helps parents monitor time outs. This simply works by adjusting the timer for one to five minutes and by pressing the start button. Its countdown will start when the child sits on the Time Out Pad and if the child stands up before the countdown has ended, an alarm sounds until they sit back down. This features red, yellow, and green lights that provide a visual countdown signaling the last 30 seconds of the time out. The Time Out Pad comes with a positive parenting guide including 5 steps to successful time outs. It requires two AA batteries which are not included. ;
