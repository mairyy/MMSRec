Title: Swingball Tetherball Set ; Description: We love this unique and portable All Surface Swingball game. Empty the case and fill with water, gravel or other ballast. Close lid, insert game poles and you're ready to play on any surface- grass, concrete, even sand. For two-person play, use the large checker bat paddles to hit the tethered tennis ball back and forth. Or bat the ball around the pole for one person or practice play. Pole stands approximately 6' tall assembled. All components store in game case. Paddle colors may get vary. ;
