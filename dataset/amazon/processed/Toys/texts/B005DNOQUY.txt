Hobbymaster's own "Classic" Coin Album is a neat, trim size. It is a practical, affordable way to keep your collection organized, protected and easily accessible. Fifteen 20-pocket pages are included to hold up to 300 coins in standard 2" x 2" flips (150 assorted sizes included). Pages are archival safe with no acid, vinyl or PVC to damage your collection.
