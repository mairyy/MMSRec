Title: Stone Age Board Game ; Description: The Dawn of Mankind. Our ancestors were hard workers, resting only very little. Luckily for us, their ingenuity allowed them to make their work easier, day after day. In Stone Age, players are sent back to that arduous period of history. With tools, quite archaic at first, you will be able to collect wood, stone and gold. These resources will allow you to attain higher levels of knowledge and build sturdier roofs over your head. Though luck plays an im&#xAD;portant part in the game, only those who master their fate will be able to grasp victory. Finally, one mustn't forget to feed their tribe as that would represent a major setback for them. Relive history. CARVE YOUR VICTORY - IN STONE. ;
