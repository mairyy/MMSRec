Title: Monster High Art Class Draculaura Doll ; Description: Monster High Art Class Doll Collection: Art class really helps to paint a picture. The ghouls of Monster High are showing off their unique artistic talents - and looking picture-perfect themselves. Choose from Draculaura, Abbey Bominable, Skelita Calaveras and Robecca Steam dolls. Draculaura doll focuses on self-portraits in a Picasso style - maybe because she can't see her own reflection. She's completing her latest piece, which she's stored in a stylish pink frame. Her outfit is equally to die in her signature colors of pink and black with bright touches of yellow. Abbey Bominable doll likes to work with one of her favorite "materials" - ice. Equipped with her trusty blue chainsaw, she's created a gorgeous ice castle that will rule the class - until it "melts," of course. She looks equally cool in a "fur"-trimmed dress with a chilling print and magnificent icicle belt. Skelita Calaveras doll's favorite class is art and she's throwing quite the pottery. Her skull-shaped pottery wheel - loaded with "clay" - actually spins for an extra killer touch. Her outfit is equally to die for with pink lacy trim, a bright print on black and a lively orange belt. Robecca Steam doll is a metal-smith extraordinaire who wields her blowtorch with energetic artistry. The welded clock creature she's created is absolutely riveting. Robecca doll comes alive in a print jumper with purple ruffle hem and a purple striped shirt. Dolls also come with a signature-style brush, art-themed piece count and character-specific diary. ;
