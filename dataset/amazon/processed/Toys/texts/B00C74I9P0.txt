Title: Polly Pocket Wall Party Mall on The Wall Fashion Doll Playset ; Description: Polly Pocket Wall Party Mall On The Wall: Polly and her friends can spend a day at the mall enjoying all sorts of adventures because they shop at the ultimate Mallon the wall. This mall really elevates play by attaching to the wall with included safe-for-walls Command strips from 3M while a suction-cup piece-count keeps small pieces in place. Girls can start in the boutique, shopping for the most sensational shoes, then take a break with a ride on the Ferris wheel, located in the center of the mall. Girls simply power it with the hand crank. When Polly doll and her friends have had their turn, girls can push the button to release them down a twisting slide that lands in the food court. Once fortified with snacks, the enthusiastic shoppers can take the real working escalator, also powered by the same hand crank, to the electronics store to pick up a new camera or iPod. Attach other shops, sold separately, to amp up the adventure with zipline connectors to transport Polly between businesses. It's extreme shopping with the ultimate Mallon the wall. Set comes with Polly doll, zipline connector piece and chair, food piece-count, electronic store piece-count (cell phone, head phones, etc.). ;
