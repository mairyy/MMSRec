Title: LeapFrog Explorer My Little Pony Friendship is Magic Learning Game ; Description: Spring into a high-flying learning adventure in My Little Pony Friendship is Magic! Your child will harness the power of mathematics and help the My Little Pony friends&#x2014;Princess Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy&#x2014;recover the Elements of Harmony and bring Equestria back into balance. Little learners use counting and part-whole relationships to help Applejack pack each Pony's saddle so she's balanced for her flight. Then they take to the air, using skill and smart timing to earn and collect stars. When more flight power is needed, they stop in at Rarity's fashion boutique to get the upgrades they need to succeed! Works with LeapPad Ultra, LeapPad2, LeapPad2 Power, LeapPad1, LeapsterGS and Leapster Explorer (sold separately).Which pony will win the race? Choose the spinner that moves the Ponies the furthest and fastest!Solve word problems and outsmart Discord&#x2019;s ponies.Learning SkillsA host of exciting new mathematics concepts is waiting in the magical land of Equestria. Children journey along with the Ponies and use probability and mathematics to overcome obstacles and carry out the mission. They face off against Discord's doubles in learning mini-games; choose the spinner that will give the pony the most speed and endurance, and race to the finish line to win! Children use problem-solving skills and knowledge of operations to identify which animated equations will help solve word problems. They count apples and determine the probability that a selected color will fall from the tree. Once they&#x2019;ve helped the Ponies complete their six journeys, it&#x2019;s time to celebrate friendship and Pony Power! The LeapFrog My Little Pony Friendship is Magic learning game is designed to teach important early elementary mathematics skills in an interactive play environment and is appropriate for children ages 5 to 8 years.The LeapFrog DifferenceMy Little Pony Friendship is Magic provides a curriculum rich in mathematics skills in the context of a fun adventure. The game is also designed to introduce children to the concept of probability and how to make decisions based on this concept through simple, illustrative activities that progress to provide a comfort level for your child. "Early mathematical experiences are highly important for later academic achievement, and My Little Pony Friendship is Magic brings together foundational skills such as addition and subtraction with extremely important but less familiar skills like probability&#x2014;one of the most useful branches of mathematics. Studying probability can help children develop critical thinking skills and make informed decisions about the probability that surrounds them in the real world on a daily basis." - Jody L., LeapFrog Learning ExpertInnovative Learning ApproachDesigned by in-house educational experts, LeapFrog learning games are grounded in the latest research for the richest possible learning experience. As leaders in educational entertainment, LeapFrog combines innovation with a breadth of play patterns to delight and expand learning horizons. Inspired by elementary school curriculum, My Little Pony uses charts, graphs and diagrams to introduce probability, counting, addition and subtraction, multiplication and percentages. For example, children learn to read pie charts to choose the fastest spinner, use counting and part-whole relationships to balance weight scales, and use problem solving and knowledge of operations to identify animated equations that solve word problems.What's In The Box?The LeapFrog My Little Pony Friendship is Magic learning game includes game cartridge and Parent Guide & Instruction Book.Explorer learning games work with LeapPad Ultra, LeapPad2, LeapPad2 Power, LeapPad1, LeapsterGS and Leapster Explorer (sold separately). ;
