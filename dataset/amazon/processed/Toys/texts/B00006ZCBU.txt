Title: Bratz Slumber Party Yasmin Doll ; Description: The Lil&#x92; Bratz are plenty stylish, but are also known for their bored and aloof facial expressions. So it&#x92;s interesting to imagine the gang having a slumber party. Would they get all giggly and silly, or spend the night painting each other&#x92;s toenails and making withering putdowns of boys they know? Either way, Yasmin is ready for the sleep-over in this comprehensive set. She sports two pajama tops, two bottoms, a pink terrycloth robe, and some slippers. But what really makes the set so fun is the accessories, including a frog doll, a box of popcorn, an eye mask, a backpack, and numerous other goodies. Yasmin is likely to appeal to younger girls and will make considerably less racket than a real slumber party.--C. Williams ;
