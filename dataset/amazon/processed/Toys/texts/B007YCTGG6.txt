Title: Lego Series 7 Evil Knight Mini Figure ; Description: Surrender to whichever boss Im taking orders from today! The Evil Knight loves nothing better than looting, pillaging and laying waste to peaceful kingdoms. He has worked for all of the big baddies over the years, from Basil the Bat Lord to Cedric the Bull. He even once spent a memorable summer as one of Vladeks mystical Shadow Knights, and was delighted that he got to keep his glowing red eyes afterwards. Some bad guys take up villainy for money, and others for power or land, but the Evil Knight just likes being a wicked henchman. As long as he has a suit of spiky black armor, a sword and orders to cause trouble for a noble king or an innocent village, he will be happy to smash things up until somebody tells him to stop. In fact, he has been part of so many evil armies that he sometimes forgets who hes working for at the moment! Blind bag opened to confirm contents. These figures come in a zip-lock bag.
