Title: Munchkin ; Description: This award winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items. Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm or maybe the Chainsaw of bloody dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon. For 3 to 8 players. 60 minutes. Munchkin is a stand alone card game designed by Steve Jackson that "simulates" a fantasy themed RPG in a simple, card based game that's chock full of silliness. ;
