Title: Oz Fluxx ; Description: Does life seem drab and humdrum? Let the cyclone of Fluxx, the ever-changing card game, whisk you away to a magical world of fun and wonder. Mingle with Munchkins, make new friends, help them with their quests, and follow the Yellow Brick Road to seek the Wizard&#x2019;s help for your own heart&#x2019;s desire&#x2014;but beware the flying monkeys, fighting trees, and fields of poppies. Don your green spectacles to enter the Emerald City, and keep a bucket of water handy: you never know when you&#x2019;ll run into a Wicked Witch that needs melting. Next stop - the land of Oz. ;
