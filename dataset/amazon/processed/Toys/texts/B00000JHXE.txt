Title: Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Toby The Tram Engine ; Description: You can tell from Toby's serious expression that he means to get the job done--well. He is a small freight engine but also pulls local commuter cars. He is dark brown, with a gray bumper and skirt. Based on the award-winning television seriesShining Time Stationby the Reverend W. Awdry, the Thomas the Tank train system fulfills all of a child's choo-choo dreams. Each vehicle has a different name, character, and face. It is wooden and 2 inches high with black plastic wheels. The magnetic bumpers at both ends of each vehicle make linkup easy. Children will become friends with each one, developing not only imaginative play but social skills and new motor and cognitive skill as they mature.--Sandy Hirsch ;
