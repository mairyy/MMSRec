Title: Wit's End Board Game ; Description: The game is called Wit's End, which is just where you might  find yourself when playing this lively contest of lateral, literal, and  level-lifting thinking. Players try to reach the summit of the board by  answering questions in four categories such as Odd 1 Out, Teaser,  Sequence, or the ever-troubling Wild Card--a nerve-jangling catchall  for trivia, slang, quotations, and time-limited queries. Wit's End is  tougher than most trivia-based games, and it's deceptive, too. Players  needn't answer all categories to win, so how tough can it be to move up  the board? Well, for every "ArrangeJaws,The Sting, andStar Warsby release date" there's a "Borneo is to 3, as  Hispanola is to: 1, 2, 3, or 4?" (And it's got nothing to do with  number of syllables--we peeked.) If you can name four European  countries starting withS(while an opponent counts to 30), can  you do as well with "millimeter is to centimeter, as chain is to: link,  decimeter, furlong, or ounce"? There's also an optional "Sorry!"  feature that allows you to bounce an opponent down a level for correct  answers to certain questions. Smart and sophisticated, with a  soup&ccedil;on of luck, Wit's End is a game to challenge both great  wits and those only halfway there.--Tony Mason ;
