Title: ThinkFun Rush Hour ; Description: Honk! Honk! It's gridlock and the little red car can't move.  The player is a traffic cop in the Rush Hour Traffic Jam Puzzle where  the objective is to get the red car off the road. To play, pick one of  40 challenge cards; solutions are printed on the back of each card.  Then set up the cars and buses in a specified pattern on the  6-inch-square road grid. Move the vehicles one by one (obey those traffic  laws!) until the red car can escape the traffic jam. There are four  levels of difficulty. Kids can alternate turns with another player or  just "play in traffic" alone. The game from Binary Arts received a  national award from Mensa and is used in elementary school math  classes. The design includes clear instructions printed on the sturdy  box, which can be used both as a playing tray and for storage. The game  cards stow away in a drawer in the road grid. This is a 1999 Parents'  Choice recommended toy.--Marcie Bovetz ;
