Title: Furby Furbling Creature Peacock Feather ; Description: A whole new generation of Furby critters is about to hatch and they need you to take care of them. This Furblings creature has a mind of its own, but it needs your love and care as it "grows." You won't do it alone, though, because it will share a special connection with your Furby Boom creature (sold separately). Put the two of them together and watch as your Furblings creature talks - and your Furby Boom creature answers. Raise your little Furblings creature right and have loads of fun doing it. You can also download a free app and unlock a virtual Furblings creature to add to your collection. Get virtual eggs and hatch and raise your Furblings on your mobile device (sold separately). The Furby app is optional and works with iPad, iPod touch and iPhone with iOS 5.0 or later. The app is not compatible with prior Furby generations. Check Furby.com for device compatibility.
