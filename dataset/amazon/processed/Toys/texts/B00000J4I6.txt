Title: Little Tikes EasyScore Basketball Set ; Description: Hey, even Michael Jordan was a toddler once. And just think of how manymoremillions he might have made if he had practiced on a hoop-and-ball set like this one when he was a height-challenged hoopster. With the Easy Score Basketball set those impromptu dunking clinics will be challenging, but no longer impossible. Future MJs can now practice their skills with ease, because the Easy Score adjusts to height, has a size-appropriate hoop, and is made of durable plastic. The over-size rim (1 foot across, with a nylon hoop) can be set anywhere, as it only rises from 2.5 to 4 feet high, putting lay-ups and treys just within reach. A sturdy 15-by-19-inch base keeps the basket from tipping; this is important for young hoopsters who get a littletooexuberant. The set comes with a tot-sized (6-inch-wide) rubber b-ball.--Paul Hughes ;
