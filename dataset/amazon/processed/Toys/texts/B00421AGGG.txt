Title: Quelf Board Game ; Description: &#xF0A7; Quelf creates hilarious social occasions for any party. There&rsquo;s no right or wrong answers, as you can get as creative or crazy as you want. Just pick a character (will you be Super Ninja Monkey, or Mrs. Pickle Feather), roll the die and move your character around the game board. As you land on different colored spaces, you&rsquo;ll have to complete instruction cards from five different categories. As the game progresses, crazy things start to happen. Have you ever balanced a shoe on your head? How long can you go without blinking? Have you ever wanted to sit underneath the kitchen table? Well now&rsquo;s your chance. When the dust settles, the laughing finally stops and someone crawls away a winner you realize ... you&rsquo;ve never have this much fun playing a game in your life.3-8 playersEasy, out of the box game playGreat party gameIncluded are 440 cards, 1 pad of paper, 1 dice, 1 sand timer, 8 game pieces, 1 game board, 1 instruction sheet ;
