Title: Chomp ; Description: It's a shrimp-eat-plankton world out there, and small fry will easily  get hooked on Chomp!, the fast and finny food chain card game from Gamewright.  With this deep-sea deck depicting sharks, seals, and assorted big and little  fishies, players can engage in several versions of the card game War (as in  Portuguese man-of-) by flipping over a card from their school and being the  first to devour something lower on the food chain played by an opponent. An  electric eel instigates a feeding frenzy whereby even a little crawdad gets to  take a bite out of a great white, but beware an Octopus Ink-Out--it muddies the  water enough to penalize any player who attempts to chomp another. Versatile and  easy to learn, Chomp! provides some silly sequencing fun for kids to sink their  teeth into.--Tony Mason ;
