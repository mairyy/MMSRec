Title: Connect Four ; Description: Connect Four is like vertical tic-tac-toe. Unlike tic-tac-toe, however (as the name suggests), you  must getfourcheckers in a row. One player has red checkers; the other has black checkers. To play,  alternate turns at dropping one of checkers down a slot at the top of the upright grid. The first player to get  four checkers lined up in a row in any direction--horizontal, vertical, or diagonal--wins the game.--Alison Golder ;
