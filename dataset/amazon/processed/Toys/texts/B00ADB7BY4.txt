Title: Ticket to Ride Map Collection Board Game: The Heart of Africa, Volume #3 ; Description: Introducing the 3rd volume in the Ticket to Ride Map Collection Vol. 3 - The Heart of Africa. Set in the vast wilderness of Africa at the height of its exploration by intrepid explorers, missionaries and adventurers, this new single-sided board map focuses on the central and southern heart of the continent displayed in a vertical format. This new map introduces 45 new Terrain Cards, divided into 3 different Terrain Types. Each Terrain Type is associated with different Route colors: Desert/Savanna cards for Yellow, Orange and Red Routes; Jungle/Forest cards for Green, Blue and Purple Routes; and Mountain/Cliff cards for Black, White and Grey Routes. Players can draw Terrain cards just like Train cards and they may use these to double the value of the routes they claim. Designed for 2-5 players, ages 8+, this expansion takes 30-60 minutes and requires Train cards and Trains from either Ticket to Ride or Ticket to Ride Europe. ;
