Title: Catan Card Game ; Description: With a beautifully designed deck of cards, playing pieces,  dice, and instruction book, it's no wonder this card game was nominated  in Germany for Game of the Year in 1997. The game pits two players  against each other as rival clans vying for Catan, a territory in  medieval Europe. By using cunning, the resources of their domains, and  the lucky roll of dice, the players compete to see who will be the  ruler. There are attacks by brigands, knightly tournaments, merchants,  spies, and civil wars. Events in the game are presented through event  cards, which can bring plague or prosperity to the clans. Strategy and  foresight will win the day, but even the loser will enjoy learning  about the life and culture of medieval times. Young players will need  patience to learn and play.--Lee Strucker ;
