Title: Hot Wheels Shark Park ; Description: This Hot Wheels Shark Playset challenges drivers to get their  Hot Wheels cars around the entire track without getting munched by the  big blue shark near the end. Cars race down a steep roller-coaster  track, around a translucent blue curve, and through the gaping jaws of a  large mechanical shark. The electronic shark says 18 different phrases,  such as "Bring it on," "It's crunch time," and "I love chrome." Lucky  drivers will zoom right past his chompers, while unlucky ones will  become lunch. Three AA batteries are required (not included). The Hot  Wheels cars are sold separately. ;
