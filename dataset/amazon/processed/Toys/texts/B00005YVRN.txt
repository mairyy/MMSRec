Title: Ocean Wonders Aquarium ; Description: This toy will makeyouwant to take a nap. Equipped with straps that attach it to a crib, this play aquarium and music maker is the perfect thing to amuse a child or soothe them to sleep. There are three settings, depending on what kind of stimulation is needed: music only; music plus soft glowing lights; and music plus lights, bubbles, and moving fish. There are also three music options, the best one offering soft and melodic New Age fare, the other two somewhat odd, spacey versions of familiar lullabies. The music combined with the lights creates an instantly peaceful, soothing ambiance. There are a couple of buttons and doodads for baby to bat around that make the fish react in various ways. If these buttons were a little more responsive, this toy would be near perfect.--David Stoesz ;
