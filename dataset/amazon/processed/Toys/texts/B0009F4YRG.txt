Title: Mad Gab ; Description: Canoe Key Pace He Grit? Mad Gab is one of the most entertaining and fun talk-out-loud games you&#x92;ll even play. Teams square off against their opponents in trying to be the first to 25 points, which are earned by solving word puzzles. The puzzles are mondegreens of small words that, when said together, sound like a phrase, famous person, place, or thing. For example, "Canoe Key Pace He Grit" when pronounced quickly sounds like "Can you keep a secret?"300 cards, a timer, and a score pad are included. "Eiffel Tower" and "A Model Citizen" are the shown puzzles.Talking to yourself might have people looking at you funny any other time, but it&#x92;s almost a prerequisite for Mad Gab. Simply reading "Sea Grit Dress Up Ease" may not be enough to solve the puzzle. But once you start sounding it out slow, fast, slurred, or with quick repetitions, you start to hear "secret recipes" and have the answer. But players should be careful, because if they don&#x92;t guess correctly before time runs out, then the opposing team has a chance to steal for the point.The game includes 300 cards featuring 1,200 puzzles with two levels of difficulty. An easy example is "Sand Tack Laws" being Santa Claus, while a hard clue might be "Thigh Sing Gone Thick Ache" (the icing on the cake). A timer, a flipper, labels, a score pad, and instructions are also included. ;
