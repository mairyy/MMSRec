Title: ALEX&reg; Toys - Bathtime Fun Bathtub Finger Painting Kit 607 ; Description: Most painters have to clean up after they're done, but with this set of five bright finger-paint  soaps, you can paint and get clean at the same time.  Squeeze a dab of each color into the enclosed  hand-shaped artist's palette and you're all set to turn your tub into an impressionistic masterpiece.  When it's towel  time, wipe the pigment away using the included fish-shaped sponge. Don't forget to wear a beret in the tub  for the right effect. Paints are orange, blue, yellow, green, and purple.  They are not heavily scented, and the  pigments are child friendly.--Richard Farr ;
