Title: Thomas the Train: TrackMaster R/C Thomas ; Description: The magic of Thomas & Friends comes to life with remote control action. The TrackMaster remote lets little engineers control Thomas' every move. A push or pull on the handle sends the engine forward or backward with a chug-chug or stops them with a hiss. Other buttons let children hear engine whistles and the Thomas & Friends theme song too. ;
