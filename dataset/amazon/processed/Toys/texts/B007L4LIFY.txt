Title: Monster High C.A. Cupid Doll ; Description: Monster High C.A. Cupid Doll: Cupid is the daughter of Eros, whose all about love and matchmaking. Her frighteningly frilly progeny shares his passion, which she displays with lots of lace and cupid icons. She wears a lovely knee length dress, accented with a black tulle, ruffle hem. The skirt is detailed with decorated hearts along the edge and dripping black at the top. The sparkly pink bodice has an interesting sheer black treatment. It looks simply divine against her wavy wings, bright pink curls and sweet heart hair bow. Fashionistas will love her heart shaped purse, with its pink arrow shaped handles, heart detail and dripping black bottom. An arrow shaped ring, bow and arrow shaped ear rings and heart detailed platform pumps (with bow and arrow heels) hit the fashion mark. This cupid will make any ghouls heart pitter patter.
