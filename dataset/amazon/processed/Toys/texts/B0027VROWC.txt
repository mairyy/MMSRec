Title: Sargent Art 22-1610 No-Spill Paint Cups with Color-Coded Lids, Set of 10 ; Description: Enjoy hours of mess-free creativity with this set of 10 no-spill paint cups. Ideal for home, classroom, church, and school use, the units' patented design features easy-open lids with locking clasps and sturdy tabs that never detach. Even more, their twist-off, grooved-rim caps enable convenient refilling, while their inner rim seals recycle moisture and prevent evaporation, which means paint lasts longer without drying, cracking, or crumbling. Equipped with lid indents that cradle up to two paintbrushes and prevent them from tumbling onto the table or counter between uses, each cup also offers a clear-view fill-line indicator--ideal for dispensing or mixing paints. Best of all, the color-coded lids provide an at-a-glance way to identify colors when painting with finger paints, acrylics, watercolors, and more. The set of 10 AP-certified paint cups comes in a reusable bag and measures approximately 12-1/2 by 6-4/5 by 12-4/5 inches. ;
