Title: POOF-Slinky 4600MBL Ideal Amaze 'N' Marbles Classic Wood Construction Set with Sealed Storage Box, 60-Pieces ; Description: Up and down it goes; where it'll stop, no one knows! With Amaze-N-Marbles, the visionary builder can create fantastically elaborate maze-like castles. But that's only half the fun. When the building is finished, drop a marble at one end, and watch it go twisting and turning down tunnels, leaping from one channeled block to the next, disappearing into an angled hole in a cube, only to reappear two blocks over! This 60-piece set contains many different shapes and sizes of natural-colored grooved wood blocks with safe, nontoxic finish, and 10 glass marbles. Explore the concepts of symmetry, balance, sequence, and spatial thinking, and hone organizational skills and coordination. No instructions necessary--it's all up to the builder's imagination! The sturdy 11.25-by-16-inch cardboard box with handle serves as a convenient storage and carrying container. Try it--it's truly marble-ous!--Emilie Coulter ;
