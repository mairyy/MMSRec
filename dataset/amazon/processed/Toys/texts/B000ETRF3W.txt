Title: Jakks Creepy Crawlers Bugmaker ; Description: .caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; }The Jakks Creepy Crawlers Bug Maker transforms slime to bugs in no time. It's easy for kids to start making bugs. Just pour the plasti-goop compound in the bug molds and turn up the heat. When it's done baking, take out the cooling tray, let them cool, and voila -- they've got creepy creatures to gross out their friends.Buggin' OutMaking the bugs is half the fun! The set comes with three distinctly different plasti-goop colors, encouraging kids to come up with festive or freaky new bug combinations. Using the goop FX detailing pens and three detailing tips, bug-makers can scorch the shades and shapes of each scorpion claw and every wormy body segment. A goop FX pick is also included for pulling the bugs out of the trays.Twice the Fun in Half the TimeThe new and improved Creepy Crawlers creates up to 40 bugs -- twice as many twisted creatures in just half the time. The brightly colored oven is almost as fun as the bug-making process itself, with a gross wriggling crawler on top for inspiration. There are also bug-covered holders on the sides that store the double-use spatula and cooling tray. Made with durable plastic, the oven, trays, and spatula are child-safe and stand up to hours of experimentation in the bug laboratory. This classic boy's toy is recommended for kids 8 to 12 years old. The oven requires a 60-watt small base light bulb, sold separately, but available in virtually any grocery store.What's in the BoxBaking oven, 3 plastic goop bottles, 1 Goop FX Detailing Pen and 3 tips, 2 molds, goop FX pick, 1 double use spatula and cooling tray.The set comes with three distinctly different plasti-goop colors and FX detailing pens. ;
