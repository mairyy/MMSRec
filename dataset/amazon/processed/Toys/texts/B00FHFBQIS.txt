Title: Bandai Tamashii Nations S.H. Figuarts Goku Action Figure ; Description: At last, Son Goku joins the S.H.Figuarts series in his base form! The Dragon ball figure everyone has been waiting for has finally arrived- this is Goku as he was originally introduced to viewers, before undergoing any sort of Super Saiyan transformation. Keeping in mind that many of the scenes when Goku is in his regular form are comical, several different faces have been included to highlight the character's fun and unique personality. Goku will include the "Kamehameha" effect parts, four interchangeable faces, for a total of five faces and a full array of interchangeable hands (5 right/4 left). A web exclusive in Asia, Goku has been made specially available for fans in North America. ;
