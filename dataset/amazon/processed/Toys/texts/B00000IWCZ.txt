Title: Boggle ; Description: You can't beat a classic like Boggle for sheer return of fun on one's investment in a simple game. A small container holds 16 cubes, each cube marked with a different letter on each of its six sides. Give the container a good shake, and the cubes land within little pockets. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to find as many words (of three-or-more letters) as you can--in three minutes. Points are tallied by word length.--Tom Keogh ;
