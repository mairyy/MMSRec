Title: Disney Magic Kingdom Game ; Description: Disney has always been masterful at two key initiatives: producing memorable children&#x92;s entertainment and marketing that same entertainment with overwhelming force. In this promotional board game, players attempt to move a family around a Disney theme park, stopping at various points along the way including Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Frontierland, and the Country Bears. Mickey, Donald, Peter Pan, Snow White, the Lion King characters, and various other familiar characters make appearances. As a game, it may deepen a child&#x92;s love for their Disney brand friends or simply reinforce the feelings that child already has. The game is also a bit complex and may be too tricky for younger children although if they play on a team with older kids or adults, they should be fine. Parents considering this game should be prepared to answer the question "when can we go to a REAL Disney park?"--Charlie Williams ;
