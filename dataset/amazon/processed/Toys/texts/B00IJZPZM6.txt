Title: Marvel Guardians of The Galaxy Marvel's Nova Figure, 6-Inch ; Description: The Nova Force grants Richard Rider immense power, but without the stabilizing presence of the Xandrian Worldmind it would also shatter his sanity! The Guardians of the Galaxy need all the help they can get to save the cosmos from destruction and this is your chance to build them a mighty ally! This 6-inch Marvel's Nova figure is ready for battle and he's armored to protect himself from the enemy. But he also comes with the right arm part you need to build the plant-humanoid warrior Groot! Collect all 6 parts (other figures sold separately) and complete the hero's body! Then send your Nova and other figures (sold separately) into battle at his side. The action is epic when you build your own Groot figure! Marvel products are produced by Hasbro under license from Marvel Characters B.V. ;
