Title: Flinch ; Description: Almost a century old, Flinch is the seemingly simple but surprisingly difficult card game in  which players attempt to discard from their stockpiles of 10 cards by playing them in numerical sequence  (when possible). Sure, it sounds like a round of this could be over in minutes, but it never turns out that  way. The original, handsome design of the cards is still intact, but the makers of the game have come up  with some additional contests for modern folk, including Flinch 2000, with wild cards. There's also a  solitaire version and one just for kids.--Tom Keogh ;
