Title: Tichu ; Description: Tichu from Rio Grande Games is a fun and interesting card game unlike anything youve played before! Its simple to learn: one need only get rid of his cards. The basic form of this game is only played by two pairs of two partners. Each players sits facing opposite his partner. Throughout the game, partners attempt to help each other score points and opportunities to lead. The first team to score a total of 1000 points wins the game. Although Tichu is primarily a partnership game for four, with the two packs of cards, its well suited for larger groups too. ;
