Title: Ocean Wonders Fishbowl ; Description: This gentle, whimsical toy provides gentle stimulation and interactive play for a baby or toddler. There are three balls, each with a different colored fish inside, that the child can place inside the fishbowl, prompting soft music and happy, bubbly sound effects. The music and sounds also play when the balls are moved around inside the bowl. The unit has a rounded bottom so it can be gently rocked, and there are two volume settings; a feature parents are sure to appreciate. Requires 3 AA batteries (included).--David Stoesz ;
