Title: Fisher Price Twirlin' Whirlin Garden ; Description: Part of Fisher-Price's Be-Bop Building series, this colorful, interactive garden has it all--well, everything except, fortunately, topsoil and fertilizer. With its twinkling lights and be-bopping music--activated by a big, blue Magic Action button--the Twirlin' Whirlin' Garden comes to life with enough sights, sounds, and textures to satisfy even the most inquisitive wee one. Twelve different blocks (including a rattling fish, a fabric-winged bee, and a teethable turtle) stack onto either a dragonfly teeter-totter or four spinning, swirly, 6-inch-wide tops. A smiling sun and a court of happily bobbing flowers preside over the garden, which encloses a soft, 2-foot-wide, circular playmat inside a tubular padded border. The whole set folds in half with an easy-to-carry handle.--Paul Hughes ;
