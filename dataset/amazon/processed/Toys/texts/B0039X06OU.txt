Title: Star Wars 174 Imperial AT-AT All Terrain Armored Transport Vehicle ; Description: Scaled to interact with 3 " figures, the Star Wars 2010 Super Deluxe AT-AT Walker measures approximately 24" tall x 28" long x 12" wide, is designed to carry a total of 20 figures, 6 of which can be used as crew for the AT-ATTMs head cockpit; the Super Deluxe AT-AT is accompanied by a 3 "  AT-AT Driver and a deployable Speeder Bike. Bearing dimensions sufficient to crush all opposition and thoroughly terrorize all enemies of the Empire, the quadrupedal AT-AT stands 22.5 meters tall. Crewed by a pilot, gunner/copilot, deck officers and a commander, the AT-AT is capable of housing forty or more troops, and as many as five Speeder Bikes and two AT-ST vehicles. Powered by an FW62 compact fusion drive system, the AT-AT is equipped with an MS-1 fire-linked heavy laser cannon, medium repeating blasters, and Durasteel footpads. During the EmpireTMs assault on the Rebel AllianceTMs Echo Base on Hoth, lumbering AT-AT Walkers, pitted against the AllianceTMs Snowspeeders, comprised a large portion of the Imperial occupation. Later, Walkers were used to patrol the EmpireTMs holdings, in conjunction with Death Star IITMs shield generator, on the moon of Endor. ;
