Title: Hasbro Playskool Honeybee Hop ; Description: Treat your preschooler to some very silly buzzy-work with this little honey of a bee. Getting the fun going is easy: just place the Honeybee Hop hive on a level spot and press the big button in the center. A kooky rendition of "The Flight of the Bumblebee" plays as the bumblebee circles round and round on a flexible green arm, inviting your preschooler to chase, dodge and hippity-hop over it. For a slower game, press the button once, or press it again to pick up the action. Like skipping rope, the Honeybee Hop challenges timing and balance while giving kids a giggle-packed workout &#8212; and it&#8217;s awful cute to boot! ;
