Title: Fisher-Price Interactive Baby Grand Piano ; Description: There&#x92;s nothing like watching small children fall in love with music. This baby grand will play Cupid to a toddler&#x92;s relationship to music. Just the right size for little fingers, with bright colors, lights, and familiar songs and learning concepts; kids will need no introduction before getting in there and starting to tickle those ivories! Three modes of play encourage children to enjoy music, learn basic concepts (alphabet, counting, opposites, etc.), or just play notes and chords on the eight-key keyboard. A plastic songbook (built into the piano) uses numerals on musical notation to teach aspiring musicians the correlation between the sounds they hear, the notes on the page, and the keys on the keyboard. Slides and buttons and dials can be manipulated to adjust tempo, pitch, and style, while a metronome keeps time. And a friendly maestro monster looms over the piano, dancing as your artiste creates composes her or his opuses. The music, as with so many children&#x92;s toys, is moderately unpleasant&#x97;nursery rhymes meet lounge jazz&#x97;but not the worst you&#x92;ll ever hear. And the joy toddlers will get out of playing their own melodies, as well as the potential for learning, far outweighs the burden of listening to cheesy tunes. Or you can just keep it in note-playing mode, and skip the pre-recorded tunes altogether! Three "C" batteries required (not included). Some adult assembly is required.--Emilie Coulter ;
