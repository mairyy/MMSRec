Title: Music &amp; Lights Sit 'n Spin Rockin' Tunes (colors vary) ; Description: This classic is still spinnin' after all these years--and now it's better than ever. The Sit 'n Spin we all know and love has been spruced up for the new millennium with flashing lights and fun tunes. Just press any of the four buttons on the handle, and you're spinning to one of six classic tunes. Sure, it may be a little snazzier than you remember (thanks to the new colors), but the goal remains the same: hours of dizzying enjoyment. Your kids will love taking this whirling wonder for a spin just as much as you'll enjoy watching them. Requires three AA batteries and a Phillips screwdriver for assembly (not included).--Melissa Wilson ;
