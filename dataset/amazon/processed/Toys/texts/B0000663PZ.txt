Title: Nerf Reactor ; Description: There is something so appealing about blasting foam balls out of a plastic gun. And when the gun looks as cool as this all-plastic Air Tech Ball Blaster from Nerf, the experience is even more gratifying. The Ball Blaster's design is quite simple, and consequently, it's very easy to use. Just push the four foam balls (included) into the launch tube, and you're loaded. When you have a target in sight, grab the front barrel handle and pull it towards you. Only one ball will fire at a time, but with a little practice you should be able to unleash a fierce volley of four foam projectiles in short order. The one we tested was surprisingly accurate and was powerful enough to cross a medium-sized room quickly. The manufacturer explicitly warns against firing the Ball Blaster at other people or animals, but the foam balls are very soft and lightweight and would probably not be fatal if one should be accidentally fired at an annoying sibling or coworker... just kidding, of course.--Chris Burns ;
