Title: Fisher-Price Hokey Pokey Elmo ; Description: What's the No. 1 group dance for the pre-school set? Hint: it's not the "Electric Slide" or "Cotton-Eyed Joe." You guessed it, and so did Elmo: the "Hokey Pokey." Though Elmo doing the "Slide" would be a sight to see, he masters the Pokey quite convincingly, to the probable delight of his toddling fans. After loading his foot with four "AA" batteries, press his hand and he performs the popular jig. He sticks out both his right hand and foot, shakes his body all about, then smoothly spins in place, thanks to a rotating platform under one foot. Elmo even spices up the beat, and sporadically speeds up the action; both innovations crank up the fun factor. The only downside: he was de-plushed, presumably because of all the mechanisms needed to help him dance and maintain balance. The result, still, is an impressive performance. He's just not very cuddly.--Diane Beall ;
