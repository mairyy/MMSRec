Title: Eco-Bonk Wildlife Series Abigail Elephant Bop Toy (USA Made/Eco-Minded), Grey ; Description: Abigail the Asian Elephant is the ultimate interactive play pal for kids to tumble around with, embrace and enjoy. Eco-Bonk seems more like an interactive plush toy than an old-school punching bag with its soft cotton cover and high-quality vinyl inflatable. The cover is handmade from 100% certified organic cotton fabric that is custom-fit to our unique pear-shaped design by a worker-owned, cut and sew textile plant based in North Carolina, specializing in domestic, sustainable textile production. The animal character is screen-printed using water-based inks, which are not toxic; do not contain phthalates, lead or any heavy metals, volatile solvents or any ozone-depleting chemicals. Our vinyl is manufactured with a revolutionary additive technology that enables petroleum-based plastic to naturally degrade when disposed of in an active landfill, over some period of time greater than one year and exponentially faster than ordinary vinyl films that can take thousands of years to breakdown into the earth. The vinyl does not contain any traceable amounts of phthalate and BPA. We donate 1% of proceeds to Wildlife Alliance, a leader in providing direct protection to wildlife and forestry. Eco-Bonk is developed, produced and assembled in the USA. Your purchase includes one inflatable unit and one cover. Fill the inflatable base with 9 cups of rice and the body with air. Rice not included (homemade or store-brought funnel needed). Innovative digital storybooks coming soon. ;
