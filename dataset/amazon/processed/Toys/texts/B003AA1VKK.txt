Title: Schylling Ambi  Trumpet ; Description: For young babies,  there is a need for educational, colorful  toys that are strong and durable. The contrasts of colors are particularly important for the very youngest babies, as looking at colors helps them to fix their gaze. Schylling's  new Ambi toys are in line with that characteristic design and quality, for they are made of high-quality, brightly colored recyclable PVC-free plastic. Ambi toys have been specially designed to fulfill young babies' need for stimulation through play, and many of the products can be played with in the bath. ;
