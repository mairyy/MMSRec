Title: McFarlane Toys The Walking Dead TV Series 4 Andrea Action Figure ; Description: AMC's The Walking Dead television series is now the most watched drama in basic cable history. Shattering records along the way with the release of each new season. Season 3 finds Rick Grimes and his fellow survivors continuing to seek refuge in a desolate and post-apocalyptic world and soon discover that there are greater forces to fear than just the walking dead. The struggle to survive has never been so perilous and McFarlane Toys is sitting shotgun for the ride with its forth series of AMC's The Walking Dead action figures. Each highly articulated human figure features the exact likeness of the actor by using a 3D scanning process and come with multiple accessories. And just like with the first three series of figures, each zombie included features an amazing attention to detail and unique play-action for maximum fun. Strong-willed and capable of dispatching Walkers with an almost chilling ease, Andrea is an original member of the group of survivors led by Rick. Separated from her friends during the chaos at Hershel's farm, Andrea has fought hard to make it through a number of dark days--first with the aid of Michonne and later against the sadistic will of her one-time lover, The Governor. This action-figure comes with 22 points of articulation, pistol with leg holster, sniper rifle and Beretta from Hershel's farm for fending off the undead. ;
