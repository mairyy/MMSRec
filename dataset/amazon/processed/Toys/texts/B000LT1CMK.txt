Title: Fisher-Price Walker-To-Wagon ; Description: The Brilliant Basics Walker Wagon is a modern walker that is fun from baby's very 1st step, offering 2 modes of grow-with-me play. The front of the walker features a shape sorting door and 3 block shapes. Baby will love to spin the large clear ball with 10 colorful beads and 2-toned jack, and flip the 4 flip pages along the front of the walker. Both of the sides of the front panel have bead bars and a fun clicker on a post on one side and a boingy bell on a spring on the other side! The clicking treaded wheels will encourage baby to get walking! When baby's ready, the walker can be converted to a wagon, just by moving the handle bar from the front to the back with a few simple snaps. Baby now has his very own wagon to carry and store all of his favorite toys! ;
