Title: Barbie Swim and Race Pups Playset ; Description: Barbie Swim and Race Pups Playset: Ready, set, race. Barbie doll's puppies really swim, and they love to see who is the fastest. Girls can wind up the puppies' ears and set them up on the slides where Barbie doll, wearing her cute one-shoulder bikini, can start them off with activation of the mechanism in her back. Once they hit the water, the puppies are off. The pool should be filled to the first line to see them race down the channel. Girls denote the champion by rotating the flag to the winner's lane. Fill the pool to the second line and watch the puppies swim freely. Girls can also have Barbie carry her pets. When she lifts them up, they shake their wet ears all over her for realistic puppy play. Includes 1 doll, 2 swimming puppies, pool, slide platform and flag. ;
