Title: Clever Mojo Games - Alien Frontiers ; Description: New Edition. Includes Mind Control Helmet Promo Card & 4 Rocket Scoring Tokens. Alien Frontiers is a game of resource management, worker placement, and area control set in a retro-future scifi universe. The dice you receive at the start of the game represent the spaceships in your fleet. Docking your ships at the orbital facilities will earn resources, expand your fleet, raid your opponents, discover alien technology, trade commodities, and build colony domes to land on the planet. Winning will require careful consideration as you assign your fleet, integrate the alien technology and territory bonuses into your expansion plans, and block the other players from building colonies of their own. ;
