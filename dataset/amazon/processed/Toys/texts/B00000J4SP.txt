Title: Tiny Love Gymini - Black, White and Red ; Description: Sometimes you just have to put down your little bundle of joy and give your arms a rest! But  where can you set someone who may not be able to sit upright? The Gymini 3-D Activity Gym may be the  perfect answer. This award-winning portable, washable gym is easy to assemble. Simply spread the  3-foot-square quilt on the floor and enjoy a vivid animal circus in red, white, and black. Slide two pliable  arches into the corner sockets of the quilt, so that they cross diagonally. Clip the beads, rattles, and mirrors  into the hole-punched arches. The dangles can be repositioned for endless variety. Babies can lie on their  backs and stare up at the colorful dangling toys. The gym will improve babies' hand-eye coordination, and  soon they'll be reaching, stretching, kicking, pulling, and rolling--an adorable sight! To put away the gym,  simply remove the arches, fold up the quilt, and tuck all the parts into a handy waterproof carrying case.--Kathryn Gustafson ;
