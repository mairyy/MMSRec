Title: Little Tikes Drum ; Description: We got the beat! Little drummer girls and boys of all musical abilities will want to thump on this dandy Little RhythmMaker Drum. Colorful dent- and chew-resistant plastic forms its 8-inch wide cylinder. The two sturdy mallets included won't get lost; they're smartly attached to the drum with medium-weight braided cord. The lack of a neck strap means your budding Ringo will be a stationary musician on this instrument. Spice up the playbill by adding the Little RhythmMaker Rhythm Set.--Liane Thomas ;
