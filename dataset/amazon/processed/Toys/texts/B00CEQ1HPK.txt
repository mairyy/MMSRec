Title: Monster High 13 Wishes Gigi Grant Doll ; Description: Monster High 13 Wishes Doll Collection: Howleen Wolf discovers a genie lamp and turns Monster High upside down. Monster madness ensues, particularly when poor Lagoona Blue is turned into a freshwater sea monster. But along the way, the ghouls make two new friends and possible BFFs (beast friends forever, of course.): Gigi and Twyla. Gigi is the daughter of the Genie and so she must grant the wishes of her finder &#x2013; whether good or bad. Daughter of the Boogie Man, Twyla is not what she seems. Often shy and misunderstood, she hides under normies' beds to capture their nightmares rather than adding to them like her dad. It's spook-tacular entertainment. Doll comes with pet, diary, brush, doll stand and character-specific accessories. Each sold separately, collect them all. ;
