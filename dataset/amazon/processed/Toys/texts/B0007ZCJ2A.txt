Title: Fisher-Price Dora's Talking Kitchen ; Description: Ask anyone who&#x92;s ever set foot in a kitchen and attempted to prepare a meal: cooking is an adventure. So it stands to reason that Dora the Explorer, everyone&#x92;s favorite bilingual adventurer, has a kitchen worthy of investigating. This entertaining and comprehensive play set features a stove, sink, range, whirring blender, and refrigerator for budding chefs to "cook" their inspired masterpieces. There&#x92;s even a radio that plays music and a telephone that really rings.A plethora of play foods and utensils will keep small ones occupied for hours.With 28 different food and utensil items included, the imagination can extend pretty far. But if your child tires of playing with the plastic pieces, they can start playing the games on the interactive touch screen instead. There are five recipe adventures that teach kids the ingredients in certain dishes, as well as the locations where those ingredients can be found (tomatoes in the garden, for instance). These food-based excursions challenge cooks-to-be and offer a new twist on traditional kitchen play.A touch screen encourages kids to play food-based games and learn recipes.Of course, the kitchen is chock full of realistic sound effects, and even has phrases in both English and Spanish--just like Dora. Speaking of that adventurous young girl, a life-size Dora figure stands to one side of the kitchen to keep kids company. When not being used, the various pieces can be stored in the oven or refrigerator until it&#x92;s time to prepare the next meal. This set is a fantastic way to encourage kids to have a love of cooking. Three AA batteries are required, but not included. ;
