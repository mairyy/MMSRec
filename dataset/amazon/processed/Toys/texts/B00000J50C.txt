Title: Uncle Goose Classic ABC Blocks with Pull Wagon (28 pcs) ; Description: Like the alphabet blocks in Grandma's attic, this set of 28 wooden blocks features carved letters with fancy scroll borders and simple ink drawings. Individual blocks feature four sides with different colored letters. One side has a number, one side has a picture and spelling of the object below it, such as an owl or duck. Unlike Grandma's blocks, however, these are printed with nontoxic color ink. And to avoid destroying nonrenewable forests, they're made of  basswood that's cut from industry-owned and managed land in Michigan. The blocks come inside a nostalgic, wooden pull-toy wagon. Toddlers can load up the wagon and make household deliveries. The blocks can also be used to make all kinds of imaginative structures and, of course, as a tool for  becoming familiar with numbers and letters.--Gail Hudson ;
