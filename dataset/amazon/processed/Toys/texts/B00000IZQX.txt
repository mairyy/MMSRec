Title: Fisher-Price Bright Beginnings Ready Steady Trike ; Description: All toddlers love to go faster than their newly walking legs can carry them. On this great  all-plastic, scoot-around toy, they can fulfill those desires to zip from one place to  another. The 7-inch seat is wide enough for sitting stability, but easy for toddler legs  to swing over. With a 15-inch wide front-wheel base, the bike won't tip easily, when  being boarded or ridden, and the limited turning radius makes for easier steering. The  ride-on toy stands 18 inches tall at the handle bars and 9 inches at the seat, and  it measures 20 inches from front to back.--Richard Farr ;
