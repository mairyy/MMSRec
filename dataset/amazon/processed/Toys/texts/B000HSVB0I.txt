Title: Safari Ltd Carnegie Scale Model Microraptor ; Description: Play is the essential joy of childhood. Through play children learn about themselves, their environment and the larger world. At Safari Ltd. We design toys that assist the joy of play. In a highly technical world, the most endangered species is the imagination. Perhaps we should spell that with a capital "I". Without imagination, the individual loses the creative spark. We intend to never let that happen. Although only the size of a turkey, Microraptor was certainly a more formidable opponent. This replica from Safari Ltd features an incredibly bright and detailed color scheme in the feathers. It was designed to reflect the latest scientific research. Like all Carnegie Dinosaur Collectibles, this model is authenticated by the paleontologists at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, home of one of the world's largest collections of dinosaur fossils. Each Carnegie Dinosaur Collectible is individually hand painted, resulting in vivid designs that appeal to all imaginations. ;
