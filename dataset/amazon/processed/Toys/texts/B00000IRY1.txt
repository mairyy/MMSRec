Title: ThinkFun Brick by Brick ; Description: This engrossing puzzle contains five pieces that look like red bricks attached in different configurations. The object is to arrange the pieces to form cut-out wall sections of different shapes (pyramid-like, V-shaped, and so on). Athough the accompanying cards that display different designs is highly entertaining, feel free to experiment. By the time you've made your way through the stack, it's unlikely you'll memorize most of the solutions, so there's plenty of mileage in this activity.--Tom Keogh ;
