He comes with his pet chameleon named, Crossfade, diary, doll stand, and accessory. The teenage children of the legendary monster menaces have gathered together under one roof to attend high school at Monster High. These ghouls are wild, they're fierce and they're totally trendy. They've left their parents' outdated haunting habits behind to form a killer style all their own. Collect all your favorite Monster High Dolls! Each doll sold separately. ;
