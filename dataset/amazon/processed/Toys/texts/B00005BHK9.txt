Title: LeapFrog Learning Drum ; Description: When it comes to musical instruments, the drum is arguably one of the  easiest to play: just give it a smack. Fortunately, LeapFrog has created a drum  that's sure to provide ongoing delight. It's an electronic instrument with four  different settings. When set to "ABC," each pat of the drum displays a letter on  the drum's top while a friendly voice says the letter out loud. The letters are  sequential, so the drummer learns the alphabet. The "123" option works in a  similar way. There are also options for musical notes and a traditional drum  sound. An off control and two volume settings will be welcomed by parents who  are sure to hear this drum being played with repeatedly. If the young drummer  pauses for a while, the friendly voice plays a little song or asks to be played  with again.--John Moe ;
