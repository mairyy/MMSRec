Title: Nerf N-Strike Elite Rayven Cs-18 Blaster ; Description: BY HASBRO INC.  Are you ready for some serious action in the shadows? You will be with this glow-in-the-dark Rayven CS-18 blaster! The acceleration trigger on this 18-dart blaster lets you fire off your whole clip with semi-automatic speed. But the Rayven CS-18 blaster also has the Firefly Tech clip to add glow-in-the-dark power! The clip charges the included glow-in-the-dark Clip System darts so that every round you fire can be seen, even in low-light conditions! Watch your darts streak toward your target and follow their glow to collect them when the mission is done. Like most N-Strike blasters, the Tactical Rail lets you add Tactical Rail accessories (sold separately) for more battle capability. Power up your Rayven CS-18 blaster and get ready to take out your targets, even after the lights go down! ;
