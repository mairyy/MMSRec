Title: Play-Doh Big Barrel Playset ; Description: The toy industry can be as fickle as fashion design. The hottest toy of one year's holiday season can often be found in the heavily discounted clearance section mere months later. But through all the fads and trends, Play-Doh remains just as popular as ever. This comprehensive set features six cans of the Doh itself along with plastic rolling pins, scissors, extruding tools, and cookie cutter molds. But perhaps the set's best feature is one that may go overlooked: it's all stored in an incredibly convenient big plastic barrel with a sealable lid. Play-Doh, for all its numerous virtues, does tend to dry out over time as those little plastic cans are often accidentally left open. But if young modelers can just get the goo back in the barrel and close the lid, it should stay moist and pliable enough for future use.--Charlie Williams ;
