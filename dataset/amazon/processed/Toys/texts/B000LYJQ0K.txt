Title: Mary Meyer PufferBellies, PokeyBelly Turtle, 7&quot; ; Description: PufferBellies are soft, chubby, and irresistible. Easy to wash, easy to feed, and priced just right to collect. Mary Meyer's toys are safe. Giving back to communities surrounding our Vermont headquarters is just one of the ways Mary Meyer has been making sustainable choices for years. Today, we know our footprint goes well beyond our employees and neighbors. The choices we make, from how we design our toys to how we package and ship them, impacts us all. We're setting a course for a sustainable future - one that innovates with new materials, minimizes waste, and recycles and maximizes use of recycled materials. Every day you will find the third generation of the Meyer family continuing their grandmother&#x2019;s commitment to make toys of extraordinary design with outstanding quality and value. The Meyer family makes toys that incorporate the quality and safety we require for our own children - all 17 of them. That&#x2019;s why all our toys meet or exceed every US toy safety requirement. ;
