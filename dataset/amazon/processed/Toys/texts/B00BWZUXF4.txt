Title: McFarlane Toys The Walking Dead TV Series 4 Carl Grimes Action Figure ; Description: AMC's The Walking Dead television series is now the most watched drama in basic cable history. Shattering records along the way with the release of each new season. Season 3 finds Rick Grimes and his fellow survivors continuing to seek refuge in a desolate and post-apocalyptic world and soon discover that there are greater forces to fear than just the walking dead. The struggle to survive has never been so perilous and McFarlane Toys is sitting shotgun for the ride with its forth series of AMC's The Walking Dead action figures. Each highly articulated human figure features the exact likeness of the actor by using a 3D scanning process and come with multiple accessories. And just like with the first three series of figures, each zombie included features an amazing attention to detail and unique play-action for maximum fun. The son of Rick and Lori Grimes, Carl has gone from being a reserved, fearful child to becoming a true battle-hardened Walker dispatcher. As the youngest original Atlanta survivor, Carl has been forced to grow up brutally fast with little to no room for childhood amenities. Accessories for this figure includes 22 points of articulation, a hunting knife with sheath, prison medical bag, prison keys and a removable sheriff's hat given to him by his father, Rick. ;
