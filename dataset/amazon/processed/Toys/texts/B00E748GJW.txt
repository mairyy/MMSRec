Title: King of Tokyo Halloween Expansion Board Game ; Description: This exclusive, limited pack includes new Halloween themed contents to be played with King of Tokyo! Meet Pumpkin Jack and Boogey Woogey! Those two new, scary monsters come with their own sets of Evolution cards. This mechanic introduced by the Power Up! expansion provides each monster with 8 square-shaped cards to mutate into an even more nightmarish version of itself! But for Halloween, the original King of Tokyo monsters may want to look a bit spooky too: 12 new Power cards allow them to fit in! Costumes, a brand new type of cards, have powerful effects but can be stolen any time someone rolls 3 claws. An exclusive card for the next King of Tokyo standalone game (to be released in 2014!) will be featured as a promotional item. The pack also includes a set of 6 orange-and-black engraved dice, perfectly fitting the Halloween theme. ;
