Title: ThinkFun Hoppers ; Description: Bringing a new look to the classic peg solitaire game, here comes Hoppers. Since peg solitaire is a jumping game, what could be more natural than designing the pegs to resemble frogs? Players choose their preferred level of difficulty (from beginner to expert) and select one of the 40 cards included with the game. Following the diagram on the card, 4 to 12 frogs are placed on the game board lily pads. Then it's time to get hopping. Frogs leap over each other until there's only one left on the board. The beginner setups will be easy enough for most players to master quickly. The expert setups will take a lot of cogitation and some false starts before they're solved. If players have jumped and jumped and are still stumped, each card has the solution on the back. When play is done, frogs and playing cards can be tucked away in the nifty storage compartment beneath the game board.--Wendy Slotboom ;
