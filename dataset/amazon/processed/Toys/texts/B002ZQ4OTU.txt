Title: Transformers  Voyager - DECEPTION BLUDGEON ; Description: So impressive a figure as to almost seem like some drunken dream born from excesses of fermented energon, the Voyager Class Bludgeon marks the upgrade of the Deluxe Class version into a Japanese Type 90 with a robot mode based upon the Pretender shell of the Gen 1 Bludgeon; constructed to resemble a depraved skeletal samurai with malevolent red eyes, Bludgeon is equipped with a katana. A martial-specialist, Bludgeon was defeated in his duel against fellow Metallikato practitioner, Whirl. Retreating into the jungle, Bludgeon later reemerged, having acquired a new larger form, in Southeast Asia. The stories of Bludgeon?TMs indiscriminate carnage have reached venerable Autobot Ironhide, prompting the latter to seek out the former; Bludgeon, meanwhile, waits patiently, hoping to regain his honor by defeating Ironhide. ;
