Title: Hasbro Playskool Bulls-Eye Bounce &amp; Roll ; Description: The arcade-style excitement of a skee-ball game is yours at home with this simple yet highly captivating ball game. In the classic skee-ball setting, players roll a ball across a surface and up a ramp after which players earn points based on which hole the ball lands in. In an alternate setting, players must bounce a ball on a tiny trampoline-like platform and again earn points based on where the ball ends up. An electronic voice tells you your score and offers words of encouragement. Three different games are available on each setting: target practice, "match me", and a high score challenge. We liked the variety offered in such a simple toy and appreciated how easily the whole kit can be folded and put away when not in use.--Charlie Williams ;
