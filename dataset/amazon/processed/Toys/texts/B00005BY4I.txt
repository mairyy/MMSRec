Title: Electronic Catch Phrase ; Description: Ever play "Hot Potato" with a spud that ticks and talks? Welcome to  Electronic Catch Phrase, the battery-powered (three AAA, not included) blend of  clue deduction and race against the clock. Two teams of two or more players each  alternate turns, guessing the answers to clues in 11 categories, from Food &  Drink to Tech & Inventions. Set the timer on the discus-like game unit, and the  clue-giving countdown begins; if a team's guess matches the response on the  game's readout, pass the unit to the opponents. Just don't get caught holding  this potato when the buzzer sounds (after about a minute of increasingly  insistent beating), as the other team will score a point, possession being nine- tenths of the "Awww!" With its infectious mix of fast, nerve-wracking, high- pressure passing the buck, Electronic Catch Phrase spreads a serious case of  fun.--Tony Mason ;
