Title: Hasbro Whac-A-Mole Game ; Description: The classic carnival game of Whac-a-mole comes right into your house in this energetic and highly silly home version. The inherent cruelty of this game is tempered considerably by how much fun the moles appear to be having while receiving repeated blows to the head with big plastic mallets. It must help that each mole gets to wear a helmet, each a different color. One to four players can join in by whacking the critter in front of them during the "sign in" period at the beginning of the game. The object of the game, naturally, is to whack the moles as they pop up and players can choose to have them light up or not. Parents should be aware of course that they are giving big plastic mallets to very young children and the result will almost certainly be that one kid whacks another before too long. It&#x92;s just bound to happen. But if those energies can be re-directed toward the moles, this is a fun and silly way to play inside.--Charlie Williams ;
