Title: Kings in the Corner Game ; Description: Here's a fittingly regal version of the classic card game of  royal sequencing, accentuated with a durable plastic folding play tray  and scoring chips. Players play cards, in descending order and  alternating color, on any exposed card in the tray. The object is to  get rid of all the cards in your hand. Haven't got a black queen to  play on that red king, or a red seven for that black eight, Your  Highness? Well, draw a card from the deck--and toss a chip into the  royal treasury while you're at it! Get rid of all your cards and  collect the pot--including one chip for every card remaining in  opponents' hands. First to 100 wins. When it comes to fast-paced fun  for your whole royal family, Kings in the Corner by Jax is  wild!--Tony Mason ;
