Title: Quercetti Filo Lacing Set ; Description: With Filo it will be super fun to create beautiful multicolour designs and then undo them to start all over again. All you need to do is slide a lace into the special lacing-pen, press it into the self-locking slots on the board, and start tracing the designs you like to create some very special string art. Enclosed with the instruction manual are the pattern cards that provide different templates to copy with different levels of difficulty, to exercise your imagination before you start creating your own free-style patterns. This is a highly educational toy that develops artistic skills, dexterity and coordination while encouraging creative thinking. ;
