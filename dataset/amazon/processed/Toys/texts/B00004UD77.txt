Title: Lamaze Play and Grow: Bright Friends Collection - Tucker the Turtle ; Description: Tucker the turtle is made from soft lime green and lavender  velour with brightly colored, boldly patterned trims. Each foot rattles  or crinkles when touched. Tucker's shell features bright geometric  shapes and his underbelly is an unbreakable mirror perfect for  self-discovery. Two plastic rings and a triangular plastic link are attached  to his looped tail. His smiling face squeaks when pressed firmly and  can even be tucked inside his shell with a grownup's help, though this  turtle has no reason to hide his head.--Tami Horiuchi ;
