Title: Little Tikes Mulching Mower ; Description: A realistically noisy pretend lawn mower with fun visual effects, this one is likely to get a good deal of use by toddlers who want to play grownup. The coolest part of this toy is the see-through plastic mulch compartment. It's full of tiny colored beads that dance around when the mower is in motion, giving the illusion of grass being mulched. An on/off key, gear switch, gas cap, and a loud popping noise add to the entertaining components. Made in typically durable Little Tikes fashion, this toy will stand up to many miles of lawn mowing.--Jane Snyder ;
