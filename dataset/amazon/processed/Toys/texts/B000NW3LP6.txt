Designed for children ages three and older, the pirate ship comes complete with its own pirates, treasure, and more -- ready to sail where your child's imagination takes it!Plenty of Imaginative ActionThe pirates have plenty to do, thanks to special "action points" all over the ship. Your child can simply place a pirate on one of the ship's five special areas, turn the figure, and watch the action! The pirates can lower the ship's sails, drop the anchor, and fire the three hidden cannons. Two pirates can even fight a duel, and the captain can extend the plank for some unlucky soul to walk.Built Tough for Adventurous JourneysLike all Fisher Price toys, the Adventures Pirate Ship is built tough, with larger pieces that are easier and safer for little hands to manipulate. It includes three pirates with interchangeable hats and swords, a treasure map, treasure chest filled with treasure, and a cannon that really works. Additional accessories are sold separately. Your child will have hours of fun entering an imaginary world of adventure. However, pirates should use this ship on an imaginary sea only -- it's not built for use in real water. The pirate ship measures about 19 by 7.5 by 18.5 inches. It does not require any batteries.What's in the BoxPirate ship, 2 pirates with interchangeable hats and swords, and treasure chest with treasure.The pirate ship can drop an anchor and fire three hidden cannons.View larger.You can raise and lower the ship's realistic sails.View larger. ;
