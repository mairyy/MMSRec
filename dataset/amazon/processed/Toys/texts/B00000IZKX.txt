Title: POOF-Slinky Model #100 Metal Original Slinky in Box, Single Item, Silver ; Description: Long a favorite of kids and physics instructors alike, Slinky is the consummate entertainer as it  walks down the stairs or comes alive in a child's hands. Slinky originated in 1945 as part of an antivibration  device developed by American naval engineer Richard James, who thought the spring might be a  successful toy because of its comical walking behavior. Over half a century later, Slinky still lives.-- Joan DeClaire ;
