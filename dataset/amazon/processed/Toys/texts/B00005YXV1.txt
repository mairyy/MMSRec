Title: Disney Mattel Fisher-Price Electronic &quot;Magic Rattle Pooh&quot; Plush Winnie The Pooh ; Description: Shake, rattle, and wobble! Sitting 10 inches tall, Magic Rattle Pooh is a young likeness of the honey-loving bear, right down to his too small red T-shirt. In his left hand he holds a small plastic rattle, a miniature of the one included for tots. When the child shakes the rattle in front of Pooh, a motion sensor detects the movement and causes the bear to react. Pooh's rattle lights up, his head rolls from side to side, his body rocks back and forth, music plays, and he babbles in words that only a toddler would comprehend. The same effect happens when hands pick him up, drop him, or just jiggle him around. Bonuses are that he never topples over, the volume level isn't deafening, the actions and sound are pretty cute, and he's surprisingly huggable. Magic Rattle Pooh shuts off once small hands stop moving the rattle (or Pooh himself), or he can be manually turned off by a switch on the covered battery box. Batteries are included.--Pam Lauer ;
