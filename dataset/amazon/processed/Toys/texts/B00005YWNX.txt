Title: Simpsons Clue ; Description: Okay, it's not the most complex toy that's ever been attempted. They didn't re-invent the rules of the classic murder mystery gameClue, they simply reproduced it with characters, locations, and weapons from the world ofThe Simpsons. But that simplicity is what makes this set so much darn fun. In this version, Mr. Burns has been found dead. Marge is now Mrs. Peacock, Homer is Mr. Green, Krusty is Colonel Mustard, Bart is Professor Plum, Lisa takes the role of Miss Scarlet, and, perhaps most delightfully, Waylon Smithers, is Mrs. White. Weapons include a poison donut and a plutonium rod, while locales include the power plant and Krustylu Studios. If all these references confuse you, well, it's still a game ofClueand a great game to play. But if these references send you off into a gleeful reverie of repeated catch phrases and favorite episode memories, then you really need this game.--John Moe ;
