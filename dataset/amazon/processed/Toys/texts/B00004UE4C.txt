Title: Crayola Color Wonder Markers and Paper ; Description: If you have kids, and you also have markers, then sometimes...you have trouble. But not anymore with Crayola Color Wonder! These specially designed markers have been developed so the color only appears on Color Wonder paper - as opposed to skin, clothing, carpeting, wallpaper, painted walls, or upholstery. Your child simply colors and draws with the clear-tipped Color Wonder markers on the special paper, and the color magically appears in a matter of seconds! It's from Crayola, so you already know it's good! The Crayola Color Wonder Markers and Paper set comes with six Color Wonder markers, a 30-sheet tablet of Color Wonder paper, and a storage pouch.
