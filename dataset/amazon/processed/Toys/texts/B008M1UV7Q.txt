Title: Fisher-Price Disney's Jake and The Never Land Pirates Skull Island ; Description: Now you can visit one of the iconic locations from the Jake and the Never Land Pirates show with the Skull Island Play set. Press the tiki head to trap other characters in the mouth of Skull Rock as it opens and closes. Flip up the eye-patch hatch to look and see if your pirate enemies are on their way. You can insert the flag on the crow's nest or the beach as Skull Island comes to life with a real working cannon that shoots "water-ball" projectiles. Peg a figure into the mouth area, spin the hidden revolving door and the figure disappears to the back of the skull. Play set comes with an articulated Peter Pan figure, three "water-balls" and a treasure chest. ;
