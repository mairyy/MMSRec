However, with the aid of the simple focusing gauge on the I.R.I.S. lens that surrounds the magnifying lens, this initial awkwardness is quickly overcome.On the lowest setting the LEDs occasionally proved to be too bright for viewing lighter-colored objects, and these images could not be seen clearly on the TV screen. On the higher magnification settings, however, this did not seem to be a problem and textures and colors came through flawlessly.What's in the BoxEyeClops Bionic Eye and Brain Case, I.R.I.S. lens attachment, viewing dish and tube, and base. ;
