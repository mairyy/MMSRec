Title: Nerf N-Strike Firefly REV-8 ; Description: Don&#x92;t let something as inconsequential as nightfall or even total darkness stop you from having fun shooting Nerf projectiles all over the place. This Nerf weapon is built for nighttime maneuvers, featuring eight glow-in-the-dark darts that can either be loaded up for rapid fire or stored on the back of the weapon for later use. Some parts light up with a soft glow thanks to a pair of AA batteries that are required but not included. The batteries don&#x92;t effect the gun&#x92;s charging, which is still done by pump action. The range of the projectiles didn&#x92;t quite reach 30 feet as promised on the box but we still had an awful lot of fun shooting Nerf darts across a darkened room.--Charlie Williams ;
