Title: Poppity Elephant ; Description: You won't overlookthiselephant in the living room. Pull along Poppity Elephant for the kind of noisy, musical, block-popping action toddlers love. New walkers will enjoy piling four circus-themed Peek-a-Blocks in the sturdy plastic 10x8x4-inch elephant--causing trumpeting sounds and music--and watching them pop off the seat when they pull the wheeled elephant by its string. The visually stimulating blocks, like all Peek-a-Blocks, hold intriguing discoveries: a springing tiger, a swinging monkey, a clown with beads&#x85;. The on/off switch includes low or high volume options. Three AA batteries required (included).--Emilie Coulter ;
