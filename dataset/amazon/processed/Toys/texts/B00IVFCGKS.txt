Cinderella can get ready for the ball in the playset's upper castle, complete with a vanity that doubles as a bed. Then, she and Gus can slide down to the dance floor, which spins with just a simple activation and dance the night away with all her other Glitter Glider friends (not included). Playset also includes a dining room table and accessories to complete the perfect evening of dining and dancing. For added storytelling fun, girls can re-arrange castle rooms and collect and connect other Flip 'n Switch Castles (sold separately) to expand their royal kingdom. ;
