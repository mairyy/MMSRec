Title: LeapFrog Leapster Learning Game System - Pink ; Description: Here is one handheld gaming system that both parents and kids will be able to agree upon. The Leapster Learning Game System takes the brain-building principles that Leapfrog laid out in its early electronic learning devices (which have an interactive book format) and applies them to a video-game format. Leapster draws kids in with familiar video game templates&mdash;all of which have a secret weapon: a built-in learning component. LeapFrog hopes that kids will become so engaged in the gaming aspects and familiar television and movie characters offered by this toy that they won&rsquo;t even notice they&rsquo;re learning and reinforcing valuable reading, math, and language skills. ;
