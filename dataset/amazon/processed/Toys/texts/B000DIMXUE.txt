Title: Looping Louie ; Description: Beware! The daring Louie is on the way in his glaring red flier. But instead of whizzing through the air in a straight line he flies in a circle and frightens all the chickens when he zooms too close to the farms. So watch out and quickly save your chickens by catapulting Louie up and perhaps turning him in a somersault. ;
