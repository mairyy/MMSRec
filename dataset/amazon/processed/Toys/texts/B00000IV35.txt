Title: Five Crowns ; Description: Five Crowns is a fast-paced ingenious card game. Its double deck contains 5 suits (the stars are new), but it has no aces or twos. This unique deck gives you many more options for arranging your hand into sets and sequences--the challenge is to see them make the right combinations, be the first to go out, then watch the others scramble as they get one last chance to cut their losses. Five Crowns, with its beautiful cards, is easy to learn. It starts with 3 cards and 3's are wild. The next hand has 4 cards and 4's are wild, and so on. You'll need luck and skill throughout the game because even in the last hand a worthy opponent can come from behind and win. Remember, "the game isn't over 'til the Kings go wild." ;
