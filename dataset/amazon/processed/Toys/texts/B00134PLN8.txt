A convenient product guide pamphlet walks you through the necessary set-up tasks. This process involves installing the LEAPFROG Connect application onto your computer and transferring the included game, JetPack Heroes, onto the handheld DIDJ with a USB cable (included).Before you close the software down, kids will want to create their own custom avatars using the Didjerator. With a huge color palette to utilize, and the ability to make your avatar a robot with vampire fangs or dress it in a tuxedo with sneakers, it may take awhile to get each character perfect. Once this is done, the avatars can be downloaded to the handset and are available to play in any game that uses Didji characters.Fun, Customizable Way to LearnThe included game, JetPack Heroes, stars your favorite character in a fight against the villain Gooracha. Players use math skills to free the energy buddies they have captured and provide light and life for the entire planet. Quick fingers control the hero's jet pack and gun that is used to navigate the erratic landscape and stop enemy goons in between answering addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems.Additional games that develop skills like vocabulary and spelling are available. One enticing feature of the interactive software is that points that are earned while playing, called Bitz, can be uploaded to your computer and then traded in for micromods, game updates such as new spaceships, backgrounds, or music.Interactive EducationOverall, we had a great time creating our own characters and immersing ourselves in DIDJ worlds. The computer interface was clearly designed with young computer users in mind, which makes it easy to navigate. Several point and click menus put a wide variety of tools at your fingertips.One cool interactive feature is the learning path. After game information is uploaded from the handset, parents can follow a link in the connect software to see their children's progress, making it easy to track success.Kids are sure to enjoy studying for tests when they can set the DIDJ to use their own math facts and spelling words, making this unique system a great investment.What's in the BoxDidj, USB cable, and CD with LEAPFROG connect computer application, which includes one game.PC Requirements:Windows XP or Windows Vista operating systemPentium III 500 MHz processorMonitor resolution of at least 1024 X 768Available USB port256 MB of RAM (512 MB recommended)300 MB free disk spaceInternet connectionMicrosoft Internet Explorer version 6 or higherCD readerMac Requirements:Mac OS X 10.4+PPC G4 or any Intel-based Apple computerMonitor resolution of at least 1024 X 768Available USB port256 MB of RAM (512 MB recommended)300 MB free disk spaceInternet connectionSafari applicationCD reader ;
