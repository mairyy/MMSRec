Title: Bandai Tamashii Nations D-Arts Black Zero Megaman X Action Figure ; Description: The most powerful form of Zero has arrived. A Web Excusive in Japan, D-Arts Black Armor Zero will be made available to North American retailers as a regular release First appearing in Megaman X4 as an upgrade available only with the use of a secret code, Zero's black armor quickly became a staple of the X series, allowing for an increase in attack speed, strength and mobility. Keeping this in mind, Tamashii Nations has specifically recreated Black Zero as originally appeared in the game, so fans can pose him alongside Ultimate Armor Megaman X. And with three different styles of his signature Z-Saber (now in purple to reflect his added strength) three sets of hands and three interchangeable faces, Zero comes with all he needs to take down Repliforce, or any other Reploid foolish enough to go Maverick. Maverick Hunter Zero, go. ;
