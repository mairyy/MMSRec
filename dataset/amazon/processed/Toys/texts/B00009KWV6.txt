Title: VTech Sit-to-Stand Activity Walker ; Description: As baby grows, Sit-To-Stand Activity Walker keeps interactive learning front and center-eventually helping babies stand on their own two feet. Three learning modes teach babies colors, numbers, animals and sounds as they sit, stand or even get up and go. The durable design, with chunky wheels and an easy-to-grasp handle, turns the toy into an opportunity for baby to take those first steps. The colorful light-up buttons, fun sound effects, and bright red steering wheel put baby in the driver's seat at every learning stage. ;
