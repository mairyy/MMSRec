Title: Intex 8' X 18&quot; Sun Fish Snapset Pool ; Description: This round, snapset pool is family-size and made from sturdy vinyl and  PVC. Setup is simple: unfold the pool, pull the sidewall up from the center,  cover the vinyl bottom with water and remove any wrinkles, and then finish  filling. Once it's set up, the pool measures 8 feet in diameter with  an 18-inch-high sidewall that is decorated in a colorful sunfish design. Filled to  capacity, the pool holds 565 gallons that can be drained (or skimmed) by simply  pushing in the sidewall. This is a great way to cool off on hot days or a fun  alternative to lounging in the backyard.--Pam Lauer ;
