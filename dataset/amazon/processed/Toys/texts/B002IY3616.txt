Title: LEGO Architecture Willis Tower (21000) ; Description: When completed in 1973, the Willis Tower was the world's tallest building at 110 stories. Located in the heart of downtown Chicago, Illinois, USA, the striking Willis Tower was the first skyscraper to use an innovative 'bundled-tubular' design, which, as well as giving it a characteristic step-back appearance, also provides stability against high winds. Willis Tower also features some of the fastest double-decker express elevators, traveling to the 'sky lobbies' at a rapid 1,600 feet per minute. This LEGO Landmark series interpretation of Willis Tower was designed by US architect Adam Reed Tucker in collaboration with the LEGO design team. ;
