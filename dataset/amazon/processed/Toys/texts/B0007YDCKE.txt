Title: Radio Flyer Classic Rock and Bounce Pony ; Description: This multi-award-winning ride-on is the perfect gift for young ones. A patent rubber bounce suspension is low to the ground, and provides a safe, quiet ride that both toddler and parent can appreciate. A safety saddle keeps little riders secure and can be removed for older riders. Children love the pony's ears that make crinkle sounds. Best of all, the fabric body can be removed and washed. ;
