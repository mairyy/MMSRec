This chart is robust, accommodates 3 children on one chart, (each child using different colour stars), allows you to use the ready made task comments, (for eg 'I must brush my teeth' or 'I must make my bed')which are included and provides a wipe-clean pen for you to add your own tasks as applicable. This chart can be used for children of any age and when you are done, you simply wipe it clean and pack it away ready to use during the next problem phase you encounter. I highly recommend it, even though its more expensive than some other charts available, I think it is definately worth the extra cost. Note that this is not a potty training chart, for potty training, there are some realy nice (and much cheaper) charts geared specifically toward potty training which will be more exciting for the potty training age. This chart is specifically aimed at correcting problem behaviour encountered in your every day life with your children. ;
