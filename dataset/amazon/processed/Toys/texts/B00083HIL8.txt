Title: Hasbro i-Dog Robotic Music Loving Canine - White ; Description: Move over, man&#x92;s best friend, the iDog&#x92;s here! Nourished exclusively on music (although, like all of us, it appreciates a little positive attention), the palm-sized iDog moves and grooves to the rhythm of your musical beat. For a robotic canine, the iDog is remarkably expressive, employing an entertaining assortment of flashing lights, head tilts, ear lifts, and even growls (should you flick its tail). Plug it into a portable music device with the included dual connector cable, and watch it respond while the built-in speaker plays along. All dogs like to be off the leash, however, so iDog can go wireless, too--simply place it next to a speaker, or take it anywhere music is playing. With such winning design, even those skeptical of robotic toys may find themselves giving it a pat on the head to reward it for rocking well done, or pressing its nose to let the pup take a nap. Multicolored lights, sounds, and movements, along with a "personality" programmed by your continued musical input, keep the iDog fun and interesting.--Heather Lyndon ;
