Title: LEGO Creator Holiday Bakery 10216 ; Description: It's a winter wonderland in this snow-covered little town! A special-delivery evergreen, all ready for decorating, arrives at the tree-seller's stand by horse-drawn cart, while ice skaters frolic on the frozen pond with colorful lights and a curious owl perched overhead. Just look out for the freshly-shoveled snow piles - one skater has already tumbled in head-first!  At the bakery nearby, the friendly baker prepares delicious holiday treats in his oven and rings up sales at the cash register.  Push the glowing LEGO Power Functions brick to fill the building with warm interior light!  Includes 7.5 minifigures, snow owl, horse and lots of winter accessories. ;
