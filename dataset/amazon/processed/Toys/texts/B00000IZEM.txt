Title: Step2 Push Around Buggy (Red) ; Description: When it's time to go outside for a bit of fresh air and exercise, the Push Around Buggy from Step2 is ready to roll. Just slip baby in the generous molded seat, hook up the seat belt, grab the handle, and go! While you actually steer, baby can pretend to drive (and can even start the fun with a nifty ignition key). When there's an obstacle in the way or a friend passing by, baby can honk the horn. The buggy rolls smoothly and surely on four oversize poly wheels. A small trunk in the front can hold a few travel items. Both durable and fun, this sweet red and blue Push Around Buggy is a winner. The extra-long handle is removable and can be stored underneath the buggy.--N. Mered ;
