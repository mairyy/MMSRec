Title: POOF-Slinky 300LBL Ideal Frontier Logs Classic All Wood Construction Set with Action Figures and Sealed Storage Box, 300-Pieces ; Description: Use this set's single-, double-, and triple-notched wooden logs to build  the frontier trading post, for which easy-to-follow, 16-step photographic  instructions are included. Or let your imagination run free and build your own  Wild West structures. In addition to the building parts, this set includes a  sign ("Fort Frontier"), nine cowboys and nine Indians, and two horses. Compare to the  similar Frontier Trading Post & Tee Pees, which has fewer pieces and  lacks the figurines, but features two neat cloth teepees not included here. Buy  both sets and you'll have enough pieces to carpet most of the Dakotas.--Richard Farr ;
