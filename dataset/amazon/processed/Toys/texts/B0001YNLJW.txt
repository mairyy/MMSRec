Title: Fur Real Friends Luv Cubs - Polar Bear ; Description: This electronic and interactive Polar Bear cub really is adorable. Covered in soft fur and measuring just over 12-inches tall in the seated position, the fun-loving bruin makes a number of different sounds depending on how you play with him. He will make slurping noises when you place the included bottle in his mouth, and start to coo and relax when you give him a hug. And if that wasn't enough, you can even make the cub giggle by tickling him in the right place. Each bear comes with its own special adoption certificate and a plastic feeding bottle. Requires 3 "C" batteries (not included), along with a Phillips head screwdriver to install or change the batteries. ;
