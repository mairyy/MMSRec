Title: Ker Plunk Game ; Description: The object: try not to lose your marbles. A long-time favorite,  Ker-Plunk takes a steady hand, as you skillfully remove the sticks from the  marble-filled tube. A clear plastic tube is filled with marbles, which are  supported by crisscrossing sticks inserted through the tube. Each  player takes a turn removing a stick from the tube, trying to dislodge as few  marbles as possible. As the game progresses and fewer sticks remain, it gets  harder to keep the marbles from going ker-plunk! Play continues until all the  marbles have fallen. The player with the fewest marbles in his compartment  wins! For two to four players.--Alison Golder ;
