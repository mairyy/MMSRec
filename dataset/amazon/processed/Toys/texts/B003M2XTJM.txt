Title: Chuggington Interactive Harrison ; Description: Everyone knows Harrison is the fastest chugger in Chuggington--his name has been on the Great Chugger Championship trophy as long as he can remember. Smooth, charming and a bit of a show-off, he enjoys giving the trainees the chance to learn from a master. He must be good at it, because Wilson thinks Harrison is the cat's meow!  Harrison lives in the upper level of the roundhouses, the penthouse suite, accessible by an elevated turntable. ;
