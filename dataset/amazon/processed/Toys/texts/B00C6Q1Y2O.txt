Title: Monster High Music Festival Doll Venus McFlytrap ; Description: Monster High Music Festival Doll Collection: Ghouls like to groove and a music festival is sure to be a howling good time, especially with backstage passes. Each of these Monster High music-lovers is dressed to express her favorite musical genre. Venus McFlytrap doll will draw others in with her with her hip "plunk" (that would be plant meets punk) attitude and dress. Clawdeen Wolf doll ready to rock and roar in a disco-inspired jumpsuit, looking fierce - as always. And Abbey Bominable doll who defines cool in a hippie outfit that celebrates the music of the sixties. These ghouls will be dancing all night long and are sure to continue the fun after the concert is over - each doll carries a MIP badge to get them backstage. Each sold separately. ;
