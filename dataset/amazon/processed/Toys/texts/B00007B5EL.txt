Title: Little Tikes 2-in-1 Snug &amp; Secure Swing ; Description: Young children will get the hang of hanging with this cute swing from Little Tikes. Its blue plastic body sports sturdy yellow shoulder straps and a red T-bar to keep babies and toddlers safe; the T-bar can be removed for older kids. Parents should make sure not to hang the swing above concrete or another hard surface, and they should check that the support structure is secure. (The instructions don't specify how to attach the swing to the support.) The swing holds a maximum weight of 50 pounds.--Andy Boynton ;
