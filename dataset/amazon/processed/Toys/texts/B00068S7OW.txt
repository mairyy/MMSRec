Title: Memory Game - Disney Princess Edition ; Description: For fans of Disney&#x92;s incredibly popular Princess characters, remembering the various glamorous cartoon queens is not much of a problem. That familiarity will come in handy in this version of the ever-popular memory card game. There are 72 cards in all depicting such princess favorites as Snow White, Ariel, Cinderella, Jasmine, Pocahontas, Sleeping Beauty and Belle. There&#x92;s a holding case but no game board is included or necessary. One to two players can play the game and it&#x92;s a great way for young children to test their minds and just to learn how games are played. It&#x92;s also a way for adults to ponder just how formulaic Disney&#x92;s moviemaking really is. The directions suggest one card be removed prior to competitive play in order to avoid a tie game.--Charlie Williams ;
