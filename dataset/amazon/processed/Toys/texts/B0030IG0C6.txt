Title: Schleich Unicorn ; Description: The white unicorn is of majestic beauty. At daybreak, when it grazes on the clearing in front of Yasira's tree-house, the morning dew glistens on his coat like a thousand diamonds. Only few elves are lucky enough to be able to see this wondrous creature. Even fewer have a unicorn as a friend. And only princesses or sorceresses can ride on them. ;
