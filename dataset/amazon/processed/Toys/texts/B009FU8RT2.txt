Title: Kid's Shower Head and Bath Toy ; Description: A shower just like yours...well, almost! When kids push the chunky star button on our press-and-pump toy showerhead, the water sprinkles down on them. Beyond fun, this bath toy preps kids for the sensation of taking real showers. Great for rinsing shampoo, too. Includes pivoting showerhead, so you can direct the spray, and sturdy suction-on base. For ages 3 and up. Secure to any smooth surface at the right height for your child. Position the ball-shaped inlet beneath the surface of the bathwater, so when kids press the button, it draws the water up and releases it as spray.
