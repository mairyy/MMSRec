Title: Monster High Lagoona Blue Shower Playset ; Description: Monster High 2013 Accessory Furniture Collection: The ghouls of Monster High each have their beautifying routines to ensure they always look fierce. Without her booo-ty night's sleep, Spectra Vondergeist can really become a beast. But she sleeps like the dead in her floating bed that features wrought iron and chain details, an overhead canopy and a swivel television attached to the front. Side candles, a side table, a striped pillow and chain link-print blanket add comforting touches. If something is haunting her sleep, however, she can write in her diary, use her iTomb, try a soothing drink or snuggle with her pet Ruen, who has his own bed too. Playsets and additional dolls sold separately. ;
