About Discovery Toys: Better Products, Better Parenting.

Discovery Toys, a trusted brand for over 35 years, specializes in premium quality, kid-powered learning products for newborns through school aged children. The company began when an early childhood educator first brought together a group of dedicated teachers, mothers and parents to take on the important topic of education for children through play. 

Best in class, Discovery Toys combines multiple levels of learning in every toy with safety and quality standards beyond the national standards. Discovery Toys product is not a typical educational toy that you can find at your local toy shop. Each Discovery Toys product incorporates multiple "Layers of Learning" to 1) engage a child's multiple senses and all three learning styles and 2) empower the child to grow and advance with the product. We work carefully with our design and manufacturing partners to incorporate a unique play experience into each of our products, an experience that stimulates multiple centers in the brain simultaneously, an experience that promotes both critical thinking AND open-ended imaginary play.
