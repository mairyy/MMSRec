Title: Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Roundhouse ; Description: After longs days of travel and adventure, Thomas the Tank Engine and friends need a place to rest. The Roundhouse is built in exactly the same way as it was when part of the British Railway, solidly constructed in wood and decorated with brick decals. Five trains fit inside the wooden train shelter, and the green plastic doors open and close. It connects to any of the Clickity-Clack Tracks from the Thomas Wooden Railway System with a five-way switch track. There are almost as many pieces to this line of train sets (sold separately) as there are books in theThomas the Tank Engineseries--all contained in carrying cases. All of these toys allow children to engage in imaginative, thoughtful play.--Lynne Sampson ;
