Title: Goldie Blox and the Parade Float ; Description: Goldie's friends Ruby and Katinka compete in a princess pageant with the hopes of riding in the town parade. When Katinka loses the crown, Goldie and Ruby team up to build her a parade float as well as other fun rolling, spinning and whirling designs. GoldieBlox is a toy company out to inspire the next generation of female engineers . As it stands, only 11% of engineers in the US are women, even though engineering and tech are two of the fastest growing fields in job creation. Engineers are literally the builders and designers of our world; from the products we use, to the way we communicate, to the cities we inhabit. Gender equality in these fields will provide the balance and innovation that we all need to thrive; the female perspective is indeed a valuable one. Girls are losing interest in math and science as young as age 8. Research shows that the earlier kids get interested in math and science, the more likely they are to go into those fields as adults. GoldieBlox is a series of interactive books + construction toys starring Goldie, a curious girl with a love of engineering. Goldie's stories encourage girls to build, developing the spatial skills that are fundamental to engineering. As she goes on adventures with her friends, she comes across problems that she solves by building simple machines. While the story unfolds, girls get to build what Goldie builds. GoldieBlox will nurture a generation of girls who are more confident, courageous and tech-savvy, giving them a real opportunity to contribute to the progress made by engineers in our society. ;
