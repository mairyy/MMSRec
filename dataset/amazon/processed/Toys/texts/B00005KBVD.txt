Title: Step 2 Up &amp; Down Roller Coaster ; Description: It may not feature any loop-de-loops or terrifying hairpin turns, but  preschoolers will likely find this 10-foot-long roller coaster every bit as  thrilling as grownups find the amusement park version. Molded in brightly  colored plastic, it's built for years of wear in either the backyard or the  playroom. The set's components fit together to form a downhill ride with another  smaller hill about halfway through. What we loved most about this set is the  fact that the individual parts are just as much fun as the fully assembled kit.  The car, bright yellow with a sturdy handle, could just as easily be used around  the house if the child is too young for the coaster. And the ramp system is  plenty of fun to roll cars, balls, or anything else. Perhaps our tiny toy tester  said it best: "Wheee!"--John Moe ;
