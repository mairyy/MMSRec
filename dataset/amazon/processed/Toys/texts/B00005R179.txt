Title: Little People Animal Sounds Zoo ; Description: The Little People Animal Sounds Zoo features six different animals--polar bear, seal, monkey, lion, bird, and elephant--and environments for children to interact with. Each habitat floor has a small paw print that elicits the animal's sound when pressed with a finger or when the appropriate animal is placed on it. Each animal is made of soft, squeezable plastic and is about 3 inches tall, perfect for small hands. Children will enjoy the various sounds, animals, and habitats, especially the monkey. Hit the purple handle and the monkey shoots up a vine into the trees and shouts, "Ah-ah-eee-eee-oo-oo!" as he tries to grab a banana. Also included are two fence pieces and a small plastic car for the zookeeper. Requires three AA batteries (not included).--N. Mered ;
