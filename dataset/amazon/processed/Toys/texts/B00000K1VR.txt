Title: Radio Flyer All-Terrain Cargo Wagon ; Description: If you grew up with a Radio Flyer wagon but lost it along the way, here's your chance to own a  brand new one. The body and sides are made of finished wood. Painted bright red, the stake sides simply  lift out, leaving you with a natural-finish flatbed. Steel wheels with big, inflatable pneumatic tires roll  easily on pavement or rough terrain. At 33.5 inches, the extra-long handle makes turning easy. The wagon  bed is 36 inches long, 15 inches wide, 9 inches high, and 21 inches from the ground to the top of the  wagon. The durable-tread rubber tires are 10.5 inches in diameter and 3 inches wide. If you're lucky, your  child might let you borrow this wonderful wagon.--Louise Carter ;
