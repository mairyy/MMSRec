Title: Small World Express Egg-Shape Sorter ; Description: This ordinary-looking carton of eggs is a unique shape-sorting toy; it stands out from the rest because it's attractive and adorable, not just functional. Open the robin's egg-blue carton to find six perfectly white eggs. The surprise is that within each egg (which splits in two) is one of six shapes and colors. Just pulling out the eggs and opening them will be a challenge at first. With experience comes more manual dexterity. Young kids will be able to recognize the orange diamond, the green triangle, the red star, and match up the eggshells in time. A great toy for playing grocery store, too.--Lynne Sampson ;
