Title: Kotobukiya ESB ArtFX Statue, Darth Vader ; Description: This best selling line of smaller scale Star Wars ArtFX+ Statues continues with more of your favorite heroes and villains from the original films in the all-new Saga Collection. Joining the initial release of Boba Fett comes none other than the Dark Lord of the Sith himself, Darth Vader. Ruthless and powerful, Darth Vader stands at the ready with the knowledge that his mastery over the Force can overcome any enemy. His classic armored suit has every detail you&#x2019;ve come to know and love since Empire Strikes Back was first released 30 years ago. Intricate sculpting brings out the different parts of his chest piece and belt module, while his gloves are accurately textured. Of course, the most attention to detail was put into recreating Vader&#x2019;s helmet. Darth Vader has a standard stance standing tall with his hands at his belt, though he does come with bonus arm parts for alternate poses. And, like the other ArtFX+ Statues, he has magnets in his feet for display on the included base. ArtFX+ Statues are fun-to-assemble pre-painted snap-fit kits that can be easily put together in seconds without glue or modeling skill. Darth Vader stands approximately 8" tall (1/10th scale) and is the perfect centerpiece for your Saga Collection. ;
