Title: Guess Where ; Description: Where oh where has everybody gone? In Guess Where? players will find out who is hogging the bathroom, who's lurking in the kitchen, and who is lollygagging in the bedroom. Each player gets a two-sided fold-up plastic house and two sets of the same family members, one with pegs and one with tabs. After each player hides all the pegged family members throughout their own house, they begin asking yes/no questions about the whereabouts of the other player's family. As the answers to the clues build, players place tabbed family members in the lower half of their houses, in the locations they believe them to be hiding in the other house. Questions can be general (Is there a guy upstairs?) or specific (Is Grandma in the kids' room?). First person to guess where everyone in the other house is, wins! This is a terrific game for developing deduction skills, and kids will probably end up elaborating on their answers (Yes, Mom is in the bathroom, giving Kitty a bubble bath.)--Emilie Coulter ;
