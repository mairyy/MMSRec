Title: Fisher-Price Disney's Mickey Mouse Camper's Playset ; Description: We're going on a camping adventure with Mickey and his pal Pluto. Drive the camper to the campsite and swing open the sides for fun play inside. The driver's seat flips over to face the interior, which includes the bedroom with bunk beds and the kitchen. Once you're parked, pull out the side canopy and have a picnic with the table set and grill. After dinner, slide the raft off the roof for some fun in the lake or observe the stars with the telescope on the observation deck.
