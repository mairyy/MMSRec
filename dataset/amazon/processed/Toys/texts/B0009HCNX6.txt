Title: Little Henry Vacuum ; Description: Casdons' Little Henry Vacuum is a direct replica of the real thing. Now your children can join in house-cleaning fun. With its cheery, red face and friendly smile, it'll become a valued member of the family in no time.  This Little Henry really works, picking up small bits of paper waste or small Poly Beads. The waste is then sucked up into a removable drawer, which is quick and simple to empty. Like the original, its cord reels in for handy storage, and you can fit all its accessories neatly inside - like the dustpan and brush it comes with. Pre-schoolers learn by acting out and copying what their parents do, making the range of role-play toys from Casdon Toys ideal learning vehicles for youngsters wanting to emulate their parents. This is also available in pink as " Little Hetty" Requires 4xC batteries. It measures 22cm high and 20cm in width, and is recommended for children aged over 3 years. ;
