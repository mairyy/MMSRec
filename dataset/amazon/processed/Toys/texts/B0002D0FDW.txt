Title: Incrediblock ; Description: Young children have a seemingly infinite capacity for exploration, investigating everything thoroughly and relentlessly as they try to learn about their world. While this Fisher-Price set is not likely to fully satisfy that curiosity, nothing ever will, it is likely to keep young kids quite busy and occupied. Eight blocks are included in the set, the clear cubes found in many modern Fisher-Price sets, and they are the key ingredients in the five interactive sides of the cube. There are options to stack the cubes up on a rack and then release them to tumble down with a turn of a lever, put them though holes to initiate perky sounds and flashing lights, and plenty of other fun games that should delight toddlers. Inside the block is room for up to 30 Fisher-Price blocks. There is some cause and effect teaching going on here but, as with all good educational toys, toddlers are not likely to think much about the learning; theyre too busy having fun.--Charlie Williams ;
