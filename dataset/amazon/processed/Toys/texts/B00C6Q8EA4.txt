Title: Disney Frozen Color Change Elsa Doll ; Description: Disney Frozen Color Change Doll Collection: In the new Disney film Frozen, Anna and Elsa are sisters, each with her own unique personality and style, reflective of their kingdom's trends. These fashions add an extra element of magic, with color-change features that reveal charming prints and create two looks in one. Girls will recognize the outfits from the films and delight in &#x201C;magically&#x201D; changing the designs on their majestic gowns. Creating the transformation is simple: girls fill the &#x201C;magic&#x201D; wand with water and apply to the skirt. The middle inset will soon be decorated with the character's signature print. The yellow panel on Anna's green and yellow skirt will develop a beautiful print inspired by Norwegian rosemaling designs and which highlights the pink swirls in her bodice. Gold trim and sheer cap sleeves add sweet touches, while her glittery translucent pink tiara and golden choker are the perfect fairytale accessories. Elsa looks equally beautiful in a long gown with shades of blue on the skirt and bodice and a striking black high neck and long sleeves. When treated with the water-filled wand, the light blue middle panel of her skirt reveals a purple print with snowflake accents and a design that matches her bodice. The gold trim at her neckline and waist are highlighted by a golden tiara and long blond hair pulled into her signature side braid. Anna charms in two braids. Both dolls will engage girls with endless color magic and storytelling fun. Each sold separately, collect all your favorite Frozen characters. ;
