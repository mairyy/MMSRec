Title: Chuck Tumblin' Chuck ; Description: Any truck can roll along when it&#x2019;s pushed - but how many trucks do you know that roll, tumble and somersault together with you? Roll your TUMBLIN&#x2019; CHUCK vehicle backward &#x2013; he somersaults back toward you. Load him up to see how much he can hold, or watch him do his dump truck sit-ups, push-ups and jumping jacks. When you roll him along in Roll-Along Song Time mode, he hums a song for a musical tune-up and he changes the speed of his tune to match how fast you roll him. Your TUMBLIN&#x2019; CHUCK vehicle reacts to how you play with more than 80 phrases and sounds. When playtime is over, he&#x2019;ll go into naptime mode. But he&#x2019;s always ready to have another fun adventure with you. ;
