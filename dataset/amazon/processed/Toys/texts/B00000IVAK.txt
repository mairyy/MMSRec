Title: Sequence Game ; Description: With touches of canasta, rummy, and poker, this game could easily become a  Friday-night favorite. The object is to get a "sequence," meaning a row of five poker-like  chips on the game board. The board itself depicts lines of face-up playing cards. Players  place their "crowning" chips on top of the card pictures, and can form sequences by using  strategy and knowing which Sequence cards to keep or discard. Since forethought, luck,  and backup plans are the keys to winning, this game is probably too sophisticated for  children under 7 years old. (But young ones can team up with adults.) Included are 104  playing cards and 50 crowning chips in each color: red, blue, and green.--Gail  Hudson ;
