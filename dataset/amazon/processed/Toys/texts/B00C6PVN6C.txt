Title: Monster High Spectra Vondergeist Bed Playset ; Description: Monster High 2013 Accessory Furniture Collection: The ghouls of Monster High each have their beautifying routines to ensure they always look fierce. Lagoona Blue cleans up nicely in her shower that celebrates her watery ancestry with a seashell base, jellyfish showerhead, tentacle piping and shower curtain printed with a haunted sea. The faucet handle swivels and a small tub is perfect for her pet Neptuna to wash off the land's grime. Once watered, Lagoona can sit in the black coral vanity chair (with sea-sational tentacle legs) to put on her monster face in front of the octopus mirror. Accessories include a seahorse shampoo bottle, fishbone deep-sea scrub bottle and a loofa. Playsets and additional dolls sold separately. ;
