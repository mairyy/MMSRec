Title: LEGO Chima Cragger Command Ship 70006 ; Description: The ultimate swamp battle is on. Leonidas and Lonnex are making a jet-bike escape with the Croc tribe&#x2019;s CHI, but it takes more than that to outsmart croc prince Cragger. Fire up Cragger's Command Ship and go after them! Activate the huge snapping mouth, swipe the croc tail and fire the CHI-powered missiles! Call in their Raven ally Rawzom to track them from the air or to swoop down from above and catch those CHI-nabbing cats! Then, deploy the stealthy mini boats and high-flying croc helicopter to stop them from ever leaving the swamp. Includes 6 minifigures with assorted weapons. ;
