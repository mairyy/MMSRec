Title: Playcraft Sport 40-Inch Table Top Air Hockey ; Description: Love air hockey but don't have the room for a full-size table? Turn to this 40-inch tabletop model, which is great for space-challenged households or younger kids who can't yet reach a big table. The table is made of sturdy MDF hardwood, and includes a UL-approved, 100-cubic-foot-per-minute air-powered motor. Equipped with two strikers and two pucks, the table also offers an ABS puck catcher for a quick puck return. And at a mere 40 by 8 by 20 inches (W x H x D), the table is small enough to store out of sight. ;
