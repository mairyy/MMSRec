Once you've matched and memorized to your child's content, cuddle up together to readGoodnight Moon. No reading is required to play the games. Includes four playing boards, 24 matching cards, and the rules. Winner of the Parents' Choice Gold Award and the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Best Toy Award.
