Title: Uncle Goose Wooden ABC Blocks with Bag - Made in the USA ; Description: Like the alphabet blocks in Grandma's attic, these wooden blocks feature carved letters, fancy scroll borders, and simple ink drawings. Individual blocks feature four sides with colored letters, one side with a number and one side with the image and spelling of the object below it, such as an owl or duck. Unlike Grandma's blocks, however, these are printed with nontoxic, colored ink. And to avoid destroying nonrenewable forests, they're made of  basswood that's cut from industry-owned and managed land in Michigan. Toddlers and preschoolers can use the 27 blocks to make all kinds of imaginative structures and to become familiar with  numbers and letters. The set comes with an attractive and sturdy canvas sack for easy clean up and storage. Each block is a 1.75-inch square.--Gail Hudson ;
