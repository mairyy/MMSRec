Title: My Scene Goes Hollywood Lindsay Lohan Doll ; Description: Teenage actress Lindsay Lohan is re-created as a stylish My Scene doll following her role in the DVD movieMy Scene Goes to Hollywood, where the gang is cast as extras in her movie. In her cartoon cameo, Lohan plays a gracious and down-to-earth movie star (which, according to rumors, is far from her real-life persona) who Madison stands in for and, subsequently, befriends. Dressed for the red carpet, Lindsay&#x97;the doll&#x97;wears a sequined gold miniskirt and a white velvet burnout coat trimmed in white and gold fur. Stiletto heels, distinctive jewelry, and movie-star shades complete her look. Lindsay&#x92;s accessories include a director&#x92;s chair, a laptop, movie magazines, popcorn, and a wardrobe trunk filled with various cosmetics and jewelry. Lindsay also comes with a second outfit that lives up to her celebrity status: a striped halter top, a sequined pink skirt, a pink wool, fur-trimmed capelet, and an alternate pair of heels. The doll&#x92;s resemblance to the real live Lindsay Lohan is strikingly accurate from the wavy red locks and freckled, turned-up nose right down to the unrealistically twiggy proportions. Although geared to kids as young as 6 years old, some parents may deem the clothing and makeup on these dolls to be a bit risqu&#xE9; for younger children.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
