Title: Disney Frozen Castle &amp; Ice Palace Playset ; Description: Disney Frozen Castle & Ice Palace Playset: Inspired by the Disney film Frozen, this expandable play set allows girls to re-create the adventures of the film's two lead characters, sisters Anna and Elsa (dolls sold separately), opening to feature two beautiful settings: the impressive manse in Arendelle that Anna calls home and the majestic ice palace Elsa creates high up in the mountains. Anna's half of the playset is the perfect place for the lovable character to call home. Take the airy staircase upstairs where Anna can get ready at her vanity, complete with chair and perfume bottle. Downstairs, Anna can enjoy a tasty treat in her kitchen, which features a stovetop that flips into a tabletop, or she warm up by the &#x201C;fire&#x201D; on her cozy chaise complete with pink pillow. Elsa's half features a massive room with a translucent blue &#x201C;icy&#x201D; throne, complete with a special spot to rest her scepter. Elsa stays beautiful with a vanity of her own, which doubles as a bed and has a beautiful printed blanket. Flip the playset around to reveal a majestic &#x201C;snowy&#x201D; mountain with a slide for the sisters to take a ride. Castle comes with 10+ film-inspired accessories, including an adorable Olaf the snowman figurine, who can also go for a ride down the mountain slide. Dolls sold separately. ;
