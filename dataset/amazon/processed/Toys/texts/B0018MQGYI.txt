Title: Wild Science Wild Physics and Cool Chemistry ; Description: Wild Science kits use safe, high-quality, fully compliant materials including real safety goggles and gloves.  The chemicals are packed in resealable bottles so they're safer to handle than packets or pouches, and can be used over and over again.  These experiments are open-ended and include extra materials to encourage kids to take what they learned and apply it to their own experiments.  They also incorporate interests that kids may have.  All kits include all the materials needed for the activity right in the box. ;
