Title: Spot It! Basic English ; Description: After many requests from teachers over the years, Spot it! has been adapted as an educational tool. Spot it! Basic English boosts learning and reading while having fun. The 55 cards in this game feature universal images and words for emergent readers, including sight words. Like the original, the Basic English edition is truly amazing. There is always one, and only one, matching symbol between any two cards. Spot it to win! The match may be between a word and its corresponding picture, between two pictures, or between two words. While the repetition solidifies word recognition, the pictures support reading comprehension. There are three ways to play with different challenge levels. The rule booklet also includes tips for advanced play. In a tiny durable tin, this game is easy to toss in a backpack and take to school, back home, and on trips. Spot it! Basic English is an ideal classroom activity and kids can play at home to practice reading skills with family members. ;
