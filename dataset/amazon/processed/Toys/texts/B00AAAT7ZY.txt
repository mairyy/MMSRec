Title: Mayfair Games Catan Scenarios Frenemies of Catan Board Game ; Description: Hark friend! Let us... help... each other. We live in a time of altruism on Catan. We give away resources to help lagging players. We move the robber to isolated locations to ensure the safety of our fellows. We even go out of our way to connect our roads with our neighbors' networks. Has everyone gone nuts? Ah! Thanks to their beneficence Catan's guilds reward such noble-minded behavior by handing out Favor Tokens (FTs). Each guild helps us in different ways: granting us roads, development cards, random resources, preferential trades, or even Victory Points. In Catan Scenarios: Frenemies of Catan everyone is still just in it for themselves as there is an ulterior motive for everything. In fact sometimes you can help a friend while making things far worse for them. Sigh. If goodwill really exists it's not part of this scenario... ;
