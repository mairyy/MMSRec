Title: Zoobles - Gift Pack ; Description: Zoobles, among Spin Master's latest creations, are adorable, collectable little creatures that spring to life and transform from compact sleeping spheres into mischievous, quirky creatures with unique personalities. The Zoobles Gift Pack features five uniquely colored Zoobles from the lands of Azoozia, Petagonia, and Seagonia, and three fantastic Happitat dwellings. They're adorable yet surprisingly mischievous: you never know when they'll pop open! Intended for children four years of age and older, Zoobles have small attached parts that present a choking hazard for small children. ;
