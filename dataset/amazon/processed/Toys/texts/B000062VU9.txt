Title: Fisher Price Little People Fun Park ; Description: Complete with its signature sturdy figures and easy-to-manipulate pieces, the Little People Fun Park lets kids discover all the excitement of a real amusement park. A steep roller coaster sends cars and riders into a loop-the-loop that really works, cars shoot out of a silly clown face, the Ferris wheel, with seats for three, really turns, and the seats on the airplane ride spin out farther and farther the faster it is spun. Plenty of good, simple fun with room for the imagination, this Fun Park is another great addition to the Little People series.--Jane Snyder ;
