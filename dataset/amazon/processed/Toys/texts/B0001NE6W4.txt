Title: Playskool Magic Talking Kitchen ; Description: Dinner's on! A cute toy for budding chefs, this make-believe kitchen lets preschoolers pretend they're cooking along with mom and dad, and features a couple of chatty appliances: Bake the Oven, Zap the Microwave, and Mixy the Blender. Pressing the red buttons on the stovetop makes them talk ("Hey, Mixy--what's shakin'?" "I am!"), while Bake the Oven's eyes and mouth move. There's also a whole spread of plastic food and utensils, including a freshly baked pie, a slice of pizza, a saut&#xE9; pan, and a pair of sunny-side-up eggs. Other elements include a tick-tocking timer and two attachable shelves. Included are three AA batteries.--Andy Boynton ;
