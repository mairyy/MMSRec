Title: Schleich Unicorn Foal ; Description: On a clearing in the forest, the little unicorn stands close by his grazing mother and explores the world with timid glances. He's very proud of his spiral horn, his glistening fur and the wonderful marking on it. Just like on his parents, only a little bit smaller. He'll soon be just as big, timid and wild as his unicorn mum. ;
