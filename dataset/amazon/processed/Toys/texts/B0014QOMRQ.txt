Title: Theo Klein Firefighter Water Back Pack ; Description: This red hot fireman's toy is blast, shooting jets of water up to 6' away. More powerfully fun than other water blasters we tested and more realistic too. Fill it up, strap it, pump the water gun nozzle splat. And even when kids are not playing firefighter, it's a great water blaster for cooling off and getting wet. Fireman's water spray gun features adjustable back straps and single/multiple water jet options. Holds approximately fluid of 67 ounce of water. ;
