Title: Transformers Generations Voyager Class Autobot Blaster Figure 6.5 Inches ; Description: BY HASBRO INC.  Autobot Blaster has amassed an incredible collection of music from across the galaxy. From hundreds of worlds, he&#x2019;s gathered the loudest, fastest, most brutal, earsplitting, guitar-shredding rock-and-roll he could find. When you charge into battle alongside Autobot Blaster, you are accompanied by a thunderous soundtrack of which the mightiest Viking would approve. This dynamic duo will be your fiercest Autobot team yet! Your Autobot Blaster figure converts from dangerous robot mode to communications truck mode, where he can launch his sonic assaults on his Decepticon enemies. At his side is a tough Steeljaw figure, who ejects from data disc mode at the touch of a button to auto-convert to robot mode! Together they&#x2019;ll make double trouble for the Decepticons, and the outcome of the battle is all up to you! Transformers and all related characters are trademarks of Hasbro. ;
