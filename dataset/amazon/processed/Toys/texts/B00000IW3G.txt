Title: Playskool Mr. Potato Head ; Description: He's one goofy-looking potato--but that's never been a barrier  to his wide "a-peel"! In this kit, preschoolers are introduced to Mr.  Potato Head, the tater extraordinaire. With just 13 pieces, the options  may seem limited--but only to adults. And once kids figure out the  basics of putting Mr. Potato Head together, they'll want to move on to making  extraterrestrial spuds: feet where ears should be, and so on. It's oh so  silly! All the pieces store in Mr. Potato Head's body, but young ones will  need adult assistance to snap the storage compartment door into place.--Ava Natov ;
