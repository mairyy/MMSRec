Title: Transformers Deluxe Generations - Junkheap Autobot ; Description: Assembled and raised in the scrap pile, Junkheap is a supremely resourceful bot. It was he who helped orchestrate the repair and reboot of the disabled Ultra Magnus. The mighty Autobot was so impressed with the talent of Junkheap that he encouraged Autobot Ratchet to spend an extended leave on planet Junkion to hone his repair skills. Your incredible Junkheap figure has all the speed and maneuverability he needs to wreak havoc in battle. In motorcycle mode he can evade his enemies&#x2019; attacks, and you can switch him back to robot mode where his battle axe will make him a serious danger to his Deception enemies. Keep converting him from robot to vehicle mode and back so he can handle whatever his enemies throw at him. Includes figure and accessory. ;
