Title: Little Tikes Hide &amp; Slide Climber ; Description: If your child (or your budget, or your yard) is too small for  one of those monstrous cedar outdoor play structures, check out the  Hide &amp; Slide Climber, a miniature version of the same idea. Its  brightly colored (yellow, red, teal, and purple) plastic sections snap  together quickly, and they won't rot. A red 40-inch slide leads down  from a platform 26 inches high; underneath there's a crawling and  hiding space. It's very stable--the two large "feet" on the side panels  make the unit almost 60 inches wide. Requires adult assembly, but not a  second mortgage.--Richard Farr ;
