Title: Read With Me System - Where The Wild Things Are ; Description: Make the most of your toddler&#x92;s screen time with this interactive learning system that "reads" a story to him via the family TV set and builds story comprehension and vocabulary skills. Once the easy setup is complete, pop the included DVD-ROM,Where The Wild Things Are, or any of the compatible classic books on disc into the DVD player and the animated and narrated story begins to play. With the provided child-friendly wireless console, kids can choose an interactive version of the story, where they will be asked comprehension questions about the plot or can highlight words on the screen to learn their meanings. There is also a game-playing mode, which reinforces the storyline through fun games, and a self-reading mode for emerging readers who want to turn off the narration and try tackling the words on their own. The sturdy console has large, easy-to use buttons for pausing or playing the story, turning the pages forward or backward, accessing the menu or activities, and answering questions. This system runs on three "AA" batteries (included).--Cristina Vaamonde ;
