Title: Barbie Primp and Polish Styling Head ; Description: Long before she can dress up to go out herself, a little girl can play at pretty looks with the Barbie Primp and Polish Styling Head. A stable bust of Barbie, this 12-inch head and hand figurine has magic "makeup" that changes color or disappears with the alternate application of warm and cold water. It&#x92;s a great solution to the old style of mannequin makeup heads whose makeup often stained the doll&#x92;s skin. You can also color-change Barbie&#x92;s fingernails or apply the included press-on nails and stylish stickers. One thing to note about this doll&#x97;her hair is designed to curl without heat, so it is made of fine filaments that very young stylists might have a hard time brushing. Also included with the set are hair baubles, earrings, a comb, a play curling iron, makeup applicators, and a heart-shaped bowl to hold all the pieces.--Emily Bedard ;
