Title: Spy Gear Nightspyer ; Description: The Nightspyer is a tiny 2.5 inches micro night scope to catch spies and other evil doers like brothers or sisters lurking in the dark. Press a small button and a red tinted focused light beam allows you to see your target in the dark. The 2X power telescopic lens permits visibility up to 25 feet.  While viewing is surprisingly good, because the scope size is so small in diameter even with the magnification, you are somewhat limited as to what you can see.--N. Mered ;
