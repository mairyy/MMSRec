Title: Radio Flyer Wagon Umbrella ; Description: When the sun beats down over the long haul, this jaunty, adjustable red polyester umbrella  transforms a little red wagon into a shady Conestoga. And it will serve you well should you be surprised by  rain showers on your journey. You could also clamp it on a lawn chair, a cooler handle, a park railing, or a  backpack strap. The neoprene-padded jaws of the sturdy plastic, 6.5-inch spring clamp move smoothly on  180-degree hinges, so the umbrella gets a flat, slip-proof grip on objects that are from an eighth of an inch  to 2 inches thick--even on wet wood or slick metal. Made especially to sit pretty on a classic Radio Flyer  wagon, the versatile, heavy-duty clamp also accommodates non-planar surfaces, such as a wide-lipped  wall. Unfasten the Velcro closure and slide open a taut 26.5-inch diameter circle of shade made of chunky,  top-quality materials. A 4-inch-long, .375-inch-diameter metal-spiraled neck above the clamp allows you to  adjust the shade to any angle in any direction. This beauty is made to last as long as a Radio Flyer wagon!  The umbrella is 30.75 inches long, and comes with instructions.Ava Natov ;
