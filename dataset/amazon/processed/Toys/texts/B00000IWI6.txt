Title: Electronic Hand Held Yahtzee ; Description: Now everyone can enjoy the classic game of Yahtzee in a nifty electronic version. Small enough to fit in your hand, this addictive game lets you "roll" the dice with the click of a button. Press "hold" to keep the ones you want, and then roll again. Get 5 of a kind, and you've got "Yahtzee." A row of options at the top ("3 of a kind," "small straight," etc.) is available to select preferred scoring for each round. like the original, this fun game can be a bit noisy with its sound effects and victory song, but it does include a silence feature.--Tom Keogh ;
