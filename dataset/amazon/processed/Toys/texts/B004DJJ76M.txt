Title: 8 Piece Tegu Pocket Pouch Magnetic Wooden Block Set, Mahogany ; Description: &#x201C;Click-Clack&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s the iconic sound of two Tegu Blocks coming together. Tegu has reinvented the wooden block in a way that brings new life to a favored classic. By safely embedding magnets into each piece, Tegu Blocks become curiously attractive for both kids and kids at heart. Defy gravity and push your imagination in ways never before possible. No instruction manuals or electronics, just toys that demand imagination and inspire limitless creativity across all ages. Open-ended play is endangered, but we&#x2019;re bringing it back. Created with beautiful Honduran hardwoods and safe water-based finishes, these blocks have proven wildly addictive for kids (and kids at heart) and will encourage the simple joy of creating for generations. This set includes 8 blocks in two shapes: 4 Cubes and 4 Short Planks. It's the perfect set for 'thinkering' while on the move (in the car, airplane, traveling, etc.), and it also makes a great desk toy or executive gift for adults. This set is packaged in a beautifully designed pouch large and rigid enough to store the blocks for many years to come. Each set also includes The Tegu Story -- a card containing information about Tegu's social and environmental initiatives. There is something magical about watching a child's imagination unfold. The curiosity. The ingenuity. The creativity. Even more exciting is creating a product that unlocks a child's mind. We exist to create experiences that captivate children in safe, natural and innovative ways. At Tegu, this creativity also meets responsibility. Through socially responsible business practices and humanitarian efforts, we are dedicated to helping the Honduran community with reforestation, education and social outreach initiatives. ;
