Activities go beyond handwriting to introduce letter sounds, counting and hand-eye coordination. Research is behind our thoughtfully redesigned stylus, which accommodates the development of grip, strength, and dexterity. What&#x2019;s more, the new design offers two ways to hold the stylus depending on development and experience, as well as both left- and right-hand functionality. A level switch allows you to control the level of challenge, whether in just-learning-to-scribble phase or advancing on to tracing and letter strokes.Innovative Learning ApproachLeapFrog Scribble & Write encourages young children to learn handwriting through reinforced guidance and experimentation. The innovative tablet also teaches letter sounds, counting and the development of hand-eye coordination.  &#x201C;Scribble & Write offers multiple levels of learning fun, from early exploration of letter shapes to stroke-by-stroke instant accuracy feedback. Kids are guided to write letters in an engaging and interactive experience at their own pace.&#x201D;&#x2014;LeapFrog Learning TeamWhat's In The Box?LeapFrog Scribble & Write and Parent Guide.Discover more LeapFrog toys such as My Own LeapTop, a personalized pretend play computer (Sold separately). ;
