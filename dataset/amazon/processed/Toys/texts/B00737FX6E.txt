With PlanWood PlanToys took leftover sawdust and woodchips from their toy production and mixed it with our E zero glue. With some pressure molding, we were able to create High Density Fiber. This is better than Medium Density Fiber because it's stronger and more durable. It's safe because the wood is not treated with heavy chemicals and the glue is free from formaldehyde. Using PlanWood for toy building definitely sets PlanToys apart from so many others companies. By using PlanWood, PlanToys is making sure that the entire tree is utilized, instead of just certain parts of it. This way, PlanToys is making environmental protection a priority in an effort to create a better world. ;
