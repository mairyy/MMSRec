Title: Timeline Discoveries Card Game ; Description: Was America discovered before Planetary Motion? With Timeline, learn the answer to this question and many more. Each card has a different discovery and on the opposite side its associated date. To begin, one card is randomly selected from the draw pile. This is placed in the middle of the table, date-side up and is the starting point of a chronological line which will slowly be built by players. The first player then chooses one of their cards and places it before or after the initial card. The player's card is then turned date-side up. If the player was right, it remains on the table. Otherwise, the card is discarded and a new one must be drawn to replace it. The more cards which are correctly played, the harder it is to correctly place new ones. The first player to get rid of their cards wins. ;
