Title: Barbie Fantasy Tales - Enchanted Castle with Twirling Musical Dance Stand and Transforming Rooms ; Description: It's more of a fancy doll cottage than a castle, but I suppose no matter how compact, only a castle can pull off pointed spires, pink walls, a moving, music-playing ballroom floor, and inhabitants (Barbie and Kelly being two of them) dressed in gossamer and glitter. Inside, castle status is confirmed, as there's a lot of royal stuff to play with: a fireplace with grate, a canopied bed that doubles as a luxurious bath, a well-accessorized vanity, a fold-down mirror becomes an extravagant dining table, and lots of hidden storage compartments that can only be opened by Barbie's bluebird key. Some parental construction is required. Choking Hazard: small parts. Not for children under 3 years.--Diane Beal ;
