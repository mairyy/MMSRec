Title: Thomas the Train: Take-n-Play The Great Quarry Climb ; Description: Thomas and Owen the Traction Engine are hard at work loading and loading cargo at the Blue Mountain Quarry! The spinning saw blade on the drop saw cuts the bluestone and deposits it right into Thomas&#x2019; cargo car. As Thomas hauls the heavy cargo, Owen helps out by pulling him up the steep incline. Inspired by scenes from the DVD &#x201C;Blue Mountain Mystery.&#x201D; ;
