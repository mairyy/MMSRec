Title: Bandai Tamashii Nations S.H.MonsterArts King Ghidorah ; Description: All hail the king. Godzilla&#x2019;s ultimate rival joins the ranks of the hit S.H.MonsterArts series. Made to scale and towering above Godzilla at 25cm S.H.MonsterArts King Ghidorah boasts cutting-edge articulation technology and will reign supreme as one of the kings of all monster action figures. Superior articulation allows for re-enactment of flying pose without need for interchangeable parts. Expertly crafted by Yuji Sakai, each head and tail has been meticulously and individually sculpted. Deluxe figure set includes beam effect parts, as well as special stand and support arms for beam effect parts. Because this product features precise articulation where the wings will maintain the position they are posed in, breakage may occur when wings are pushed beyond their full range of articulation.  To avoid breaking the wings, please use caution when moving them so as not to force the wings beyond their maximum range of movement. ;
