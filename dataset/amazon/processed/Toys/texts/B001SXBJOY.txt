Title: Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Quarry Adventures Set ; Description: A busy day for the engines. Thomas and Mavis are working hard all over the Island of Sodor. They go up and down over the hills at the Quarry and pick up barrels of sand to deliver to the wharf. At the wharf, they can pick up or drop off cargo, and the wharf crane helps move the cargo from the tugboat to the trains' cargo cars. Little engineers will have hours of fun helping the engines with their busy day on the island. ;
