Title: WWE Championship Brawlin Buddies The Rock Figure ; Description: WWE Championship Brawlin' Buddies Collection: Brawlin' Buddies are so big, they allow kids to compete with or against their favorite WWE Champion Superstars. You can tell they're champions by their arms-up poses and champion notation printed around their waists. The soft-body figures are tough enough to take roughhousing, soft enough to squeeze and bold enough to throw down. Representing the biggest names in WWE, these characters talk, making sounds in response to action (like grunts) and saying signature phrases recorded by the actual Superstar himself. And now, boys can press their chests to play a clip of the signature entrance music associated with the Champion Brawlin' Buddy. Each sold separately, collect them all. ;
