Title: Light Crystal Prism ; Description: What are rainbows made of? Kids can learn about them with this Light Crystal Prism. When they hold the prism up to sunlight, they'll discover how white light gets refracted into the whole spectrum of separate colors. They can also create their own kaleidoscope using colorful cardboard cutouts and the provided instructions. Made of hard clear plastic, the 4.5-inch prism comes with a hexagonal display stand. In addition, a package insert describes the science of light refraction and reflection in language that's easy to understand.--Joan DeClaire ;
