Title: Hape - Gourmet Chef Kitchen ; Description: The Gourmet Chef Kitchen allows children to create their own mealtime "treats" with this imaginative oven, cupboard, and sink station. The Gourmet Chef Kitchen has big knobs that can turn the cook top "on" or "off", and a sink that can be used to fill a pot with "water". Cleanup is easy with the sink, hutch, and towel rack. The cupboard can be used to store dinnerware, pots and pans; or can be turned into a "refrigerator" instead. The simple classic design and natural colors offer plenty of possibilities for playtime. Accessories are sold separately, some adult assembly required. The Educo brand has meant quality and innovation in toys for over 30 years. ;
