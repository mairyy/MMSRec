Title: Transformers 3 Dark of the Moon Human Alliance Leadfoot with Sergeant Detour and Steeljaw ; Description: Steeljaw loves the feel of wind whipping across his sensors as Leadfoot screams around a track. The cyber-dog is ill-tempered, rickety, and occasionally emits noxious fumes or sparks bad enough to set his surroundings on fire, but Leadfoot doesn't mind. Even the humans Leadfoot works with have learned to appreciate having a mean robot dog with a powerful bite around. The set includes Leadfoot figure, Steeljaw figure that converts into a missile launcher, and Sergeant Detour figure that interacts with Leadfoot. ;
