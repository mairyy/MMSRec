Title: Transformers  Deluxe Sideways ; Description: "Back on CYBERTRON, SIDEWAYS was a simple courier who avoided combat at all costs. He tried to always remain in the shadow of larger DECEPTICONS, where the AUTOBOTS might not notice him. On Earth, he&#x2019;s keeping much the same practice. He teamed up with DEMOLISHORearly on, and hopes that if the AUTOBOTS find them, the big CONSTRUCTICON can keep him safe.    Team up with this DECEPTICON soldier and get ready to take on AUTOBOT forces!  Unleash a spinning &#x201C;saw blade&#x201D; courtesy of MECH ALIVE gearing in robot mode. Then, with a few twists and turns, convert the robot figure to a super sleek sports car in vehicle mode &#x2013; and get ready to roll over the competition!" ;
