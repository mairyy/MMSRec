Title: LeapFrog LeapStart&reg; Learning Table ; Description: This is a happy, noisy toy that should amuse most toddlers. Everything that can be touched reacts in some way, from a trombone-playing frog to a book that sings the alphabet. Our favorite is the colored keyboard that sings each color you press. The tabletop can be placed on the floor for those still in the crawling phase, or can sit on the included legs for a sturdy surface and leaning spot for little ones who are new to walking. If there is any fault with the Learning Table, it may be that it has too many features: each element of the table reacts in two different ways, depending on whether it's in Learn Mode or Music Mode. (Modes are switched by flipping the page of the book mounted in the center of the table.) Though this means more fun stuff for kids to hear, the mode concept is not one that they can be expected to understand, and the effect of the toy's inconsistent reactions is likely to be confusion.--David Stoesz ;
