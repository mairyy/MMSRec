Title: Nerf Big Bad Bow ; Description: Nerf has entered into many parts of the world of sporting goods. Basketball, of course, and football being the most famous. But who would have ever thought that there would be Nerf archery? The whimsically and accurately titled Big Bad Bow comes with three hard foam rubber arrows that you pull back and launch (the packaging claims 40 feet, ours came up a little short of that but not by much). There&#x92;s a target scope to help take careful aim at targets. Unlike archery, the arrows can&#x92;t really stick to anything so you&#x92;re better off using them to knock over pyramids and things like that. Also unlike a traditional bow and arrow, there&#x92;s a trigger mechanism that actually does the firing. Still the traditional and low-tech approach is refreshing and, most importantly, fun.--Charlie Williams ;
