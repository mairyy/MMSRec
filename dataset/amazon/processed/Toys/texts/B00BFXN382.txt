Title: He-Man Masters of the Universe Classics RAM MAN Exclusive Figure Motu ; Description: Someone's been bulking up... and it shows! This beefy boy is ready to knock some sense into Skeletor or anyone else who tries to get past him. Ram Man, one of the earliest figures from the vintage MOTU line, is finally available in the Classics line as a fully articulated figure, with a new tool that's almost twice as big as a standard figure. He comes with his trademark short axe and an alternate 200X-inspired helmet-less head. ;
