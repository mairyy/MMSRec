Title: Playhut School Bus ; Description: Long before children are old enough to ride a yellow school bus, they long to be a passenger in this intriguing vehicle. Toddlers and preschoolers will especially appreciate this nylon, pop-up bus that measures a whopping 50 inches tall, 36 inches long, and 25 inches wide and is shaped just like a real bus. Once the freestanding bus is set up (it literally pops out of a sack and snaps into shape), children can set up chairs and walk about inside, dreaming up all kinds of imaginative school stories and bus-driver dramas. The yellow and black bus comes with a built-in crawl-through divider between front and back. Park a chair in the driver's seat and children can turn the built-in steering wheel. Folding takes patience and practice, but it will all fit--amazingly--into a small storage sack.--Gail Hudson ;
