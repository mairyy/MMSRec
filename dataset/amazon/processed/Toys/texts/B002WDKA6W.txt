Title: Small World Cursed Expansion Board Game (2nd Printing) ; Description: Hit a man while he's down - Goblins conquer In Decline regions at one less cost... Kobolds aren't necessarily cowards... They just like to work in teams. It takes 2 Kobolds to occupy a region after you've conquered it... Your people are now Cursed! Skip over this Special Power and you'll have to pay 3 coins, not the 1 that is usual... The only thing better than conquering is Ransacking. Take 1 coin away from an opponent for every territory you conquer... The Hordes are at the door. Add the 2 Hordes of tokens to increase the size of your active Race... The moon is full and the Were-people are howling. At night (even-numbered turns) the Were- power lets you conquer all regions with 2 less tokens than normal... It's time for Double-Jeopardy! After an initial attack, Marauding forces get a second chance each turn to conquer even more territory... ;
