Title: Just Play Doc McStuffins Get Better Checkup Center Playset ; Description: The Doc McStuffins Get Better Checkup Center has everything kids need to imagine they are healing toys and giving healthy checkups right along with Doc McStuffins. Doc's friend Lambie is included and lights and sounds are activated when she is on the checkup table. Future doctors can use the electronic Big Book of Boo Boos to make a diagnosis, slide in play x-rays to activate lights and Lambie phrases and move the leaf up and down to measure their patient's height. Kids can also use the portable scale to check their patient's weight and take the ouches away with bandage stickers from the dispenser on the clinic door. ;
