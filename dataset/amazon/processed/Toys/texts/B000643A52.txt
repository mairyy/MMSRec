Title: Touch &amp; Tickle Rounds ; Description: Curious babies (and what babyisn&#x92;tcurious?) will pursue these sense-stimulating balls high and low, day and night. Much like the popular Peek-A-Blocks, these balls are made of nubbly, smooth, rough, fuzzy, bumpy textures that tickle baby&#x92;s fingers and spur her imagination. The brightly colored Touch & Tickle Rounds are just the right size for tiny hands. The youngest infant will clutch and gnaw on the inviting materials and bumps on each ball, while crawlers will chase them, bang them, toss them, hide them--in short, get creative! From satiny bits of fabric to corrugated rubber surfaces, this set of six is destined to be a big favorite. By the way, baby will never forgive you if you don&#x92;t buy the other coordinating sets: Look-a-Rounds and Listen-Up Rounds. There&#x92;s got to be an extra IQ point or two in it for baby, right? (Ages 6 months to 2 years).--Emilie Coulter ;
