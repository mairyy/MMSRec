Title: Boggle Junior Game ; Description: There's no need to be boggled by words. Boggle Jr. helps children learn letters, spelling, and reading while having loads of fun! This easy version of the terrifically popular adult Boggle uses pictures and matching games to allow children to make the connection between objects and their names. With two skill levels, players can challenge themselves further as they become more adept at identifying letters and words. It will seem like no time at all before kids are begging to play their parents' version of Boggle! The game, for one or more players, includes a game tray with word cover, 30 picture/word cards with 60 three- and four-letter words, and eight letter cubes.--Emilie Coulter ;
