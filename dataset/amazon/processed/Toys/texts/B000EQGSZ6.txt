Title: Fisher-Price Fun 2 Learn Preschool Center ; Description: What a great way to learn while having fun &#8212; a Preschool Center that&#8217;s two toys in one! The friendly clock character guides kids through learning how to make uppercase letters, lowercase letters and numbers, as well as discovering step-by-step ways to make shapes and draw pictures&#8212;all with the help of a light-up screen. It really is fun to learn with music, songs, games, encouraging phrases, and loads of rewards! The Preschool Center becomes a Music Center when the desktop is lifted. Get ready to move, wiggle, jump, sing and dance! Two drums with plenty of personality are full of smiles as they talk, sing and play, encouraging kids to &#8220;Follow the Beat&#8221; with interactive learning games. Learn about instruments, rhythm, and tempo; make your own music on the keyboard, or switch to Dance mode for 3 get-up-and-move songs!  Requires 3 &#8220;C&#8221; (LR14) alkaline batteries (not included). ;
