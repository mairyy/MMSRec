Title: Disney Princess Tea Time With Me Little Belle ; Description: Before she was fully grown and swept away by a handsome beast, Belle was a sweet young girl who probably loved to do the same things that all little girls enjoy. Now your little princess can have a tea party with Little Princess Belle and her friends, Mrs. Potts and Chip. The 15-inch-tall Belle is interactive, so as you "pour" tea from Mrs. Potts into your Chip cup, Belle will ask to have some as well. And then she&#x92;ll use a few of her seven phrases to tell you how she prefers her tea prepared. When you lift your cup (pinky out!) to slowly sip your tea, Belle will magically raise her cup and drink, too. Before you know it, you&#x92;ll be laughing and singing -- because Belle has a special tea time song that she shares with her friends. The 11-piece tea set includes a cup for Belle, sugar cubes, a spoon, and more.The 15" Belle doll and an 11-piece tea set are included. ;
