Title: Little Tikes: Patrol Police Car Ride-On ; Description: If you're 3 years old, and your main mission in life is to  arrest all the Bad Guys, it's a shame not to have the transportation to  catch up with them. The Tikes Patrol Police Car is the cruiser you  need. Powered by your own two feet sticking through the floor, it's a  serious blue machine with blue-and-red fake lights on the 36-inch-high  white roof. Thirty-two inches long by 17 inches wide, it has one door  that opens, a squeaky horn on the steering wheel, and a handheld radio  unit with sound effects (requires two AA batteries, not included). The  toy holds a maximum weight of 50 pounds. The car is all plastic, except  for wheel struts and screws. Adult assembly is required.--Richard  Farr ;
