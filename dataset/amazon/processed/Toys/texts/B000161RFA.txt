Title: WowWee Robosapien Humanoid Toy Robot with Remote Control ; Description: Designed by a robotics physicist who worked at NASA, the hulking Robosapien looks like aStar Warsstormtrooper on steroids, with a stark black and white body and massive shoulders and feet. Just press the black power button on its back, and it awakens with a yawn and an "Uh-huh." You control the robot using an elaborate, button-rich remote that looks as though it could run your home theater system. The Robosapien can perform more than 80 actions such as dance, burp, do a karate chop, give a high five, and listen for intruders, and its eyes light up red and blink whenever a command is received. It&#x92;s also equipped with touch sensors, and it stops when it bumps into walls. If you ever get sick of its act, simply press the Stop button to make it quit. The robot is highly flexible, with joints that go every which way, yet very solidly constructed. Four D batteries for the robot and three AAA batteries for the remote are required. An extensive instruction booklet is included.--Andy Boynton ;
