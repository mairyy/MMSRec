Title: Hasbro Playskool T.J. Bearytales Animated Plush Bear ; Description: You know how preschoolers just can&#x92;t get enough of story time? How there&#x92;s always a request for one more, and just one more after that? If you&#x92;re like most parents, you&#x92;d love to oblige your curious child as his mind expands and grows&#x85;but there are those dishes to be washed and errands to be run. Here&#x92;s your chance to let someone else step in for a moment! T.J. Bearytales is your man. Or bear. This plush-on-hard-plastic teddy is not necessarily the most cuddly guy around, but he does have the corner on the entertainment market for the under-six crowd. Just slip a cartridge into T.J.&#x92;s backpack and press play. The bear comes to life with animated facial features and gesturing arms as he tells stories, asks questions, sings, laughs, and leads activities. Kids can follow along with the storybook as they learn school-readiness skills like listening, following directions, cooperation, and friendship. But of course all they&#x92;ll care about is the chance to hear one more story&#x85;as often as they can insert cartridges! Includes bear, storybook, and instructions, as well as a recording of "My Big Birthday Surprise" story. Other story cartridges can be purchased separately. Requires four "D" batteries (not included).--Emilie Coulter ;
