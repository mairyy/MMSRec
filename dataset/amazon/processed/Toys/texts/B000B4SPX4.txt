Title: Clue DVD Game ; Description: Clue has been a fiendishly clever board game for almost 60 years, and this DVD edition adds a whole new level of enjoyment to the deductive fun. Experienced Clue-doers will recognize the floor plan layout of the game board, as well as the cards and character pieces. What they might not recognize this time is the crime: The game's central intrigue has been downgraded from murder to a more family-friendly larceny. It's up to players to figure out which of Mr. Boddy's guests is the thief, which item was stolen, as well as the time and location of the theft. The enclosed DVD serves as game master, with animated butler and inspector characters prompting you with questions and/or doling out clues. It may seem like a gimmick at first, but there are several smart ways in which the DVD makes set-up a snap and games both fair and interesting.Aside from the bells and whistles, this is Clue. The object of the game is to gather clues without giving away too much information to the other players. Once you feel you've adequately sussed out the case, you can test your theory in secrecy through the DVD menu and the special decoder lens. If you're correct, you'll get a satisfying detective show round-up of how all the clues work together to eliminate all of the other possibilities. If you're wrong, you're going to have to show some of your info to the other players. There are ten different mysteries built into the game plus a general game that is more like the traditional Clue board game. It comes with game cards, decoder magnifying glass, DVD disc, game board, four plastic locks, case file envelope, and 10 suspect pawns.--Porter B. Hall ;
