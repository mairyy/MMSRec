Title: Risk Legacy ; Description: How will you shape your world? In Risk Legacy, every game you play will change every future game. A decision you make in Game 1 could come back to haunt you in Game 10. The risks you take in Risk Legacy are not like those in any other board game. You and the other players will shape how your world evolves: its history, its cities, even its factions and how they fight. Cards and stickers will come into play. Cards will go out of play forever. You don't forget past betrayals &#x2014; and neither does the game. Unlock new rules and watch events unfold as you play more games. No two games will ever be the same. Play your game. Write your history. ;
