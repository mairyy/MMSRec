Title: Step2 Crabbie Sandbox ; Description: Kids won't get pinched in this plastic sandbox, even though it's  designed to look like a big crab. Its somewhat rounded shape takes up a  space that measures 4 by 4 feet (and the inside space measures just over  3 by 3 feet), and it holds up to 300 pounds of play sand. Both the box  and the matching sculpted lid (or shell) are molded from single pieces  of red plastic. At the front, the big tucked-in claws frame two crabbily  prominent white eyes. There's no drain hole, so be sure to put on  that shell when it rains.--Richard Farr ;
