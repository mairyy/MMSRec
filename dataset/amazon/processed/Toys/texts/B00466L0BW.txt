Title: Tenergy TB6-B 50W Balancing Charger for NiMH/NiCD/Li-PO/Li-Fe/SLA Battery Packs ; Description: When charging or discharging, TB6 has an 'AUTO' function that sets the feeding current or the cell count of the battery automatically. Especially for Li-ion/Li-Polymer batteries, it can prevent the over-charging can lead to an explosion by users fault. Every program in the unit is controlled with mutual links and communication for every possible error so it introduces a maximum safety. These can be set at users option. TB6 has an individual-cell-voltage balancer inside. So it does not need any balancer separately when charging Li-ion/Li-Polymer batteries (LiIo/LiPo/LiFe) for cell voltage balancing. TB6 also can monitor and balance individual cells of the battery pack during the discharge process. If the voltage of any one cell varies abnormally, the process will be stopped with the error message. TB6 can accept three types of batteries - LiIo, LiPo and LiFe. They have different characteristics by their chemistry. You can select any one of them that you are going to process before the job. You can charge Li-ion/Li-Polymer battery for special purposes. 'Fast' charge reduces the charging time of battery and 'Storage mode controls the final voltage of the battery to be suit for long time storage. For users convenience it can store maximum 5 data of different batteries. You can establish the data contains program setting of the battery to charge or discharge continually. These data can be called out at any time you need and the process can be executed without program setting. Perform 1 to 5 cycles of charge>discharge or discharge>charge continually for battery refreshing and balancing. ;
