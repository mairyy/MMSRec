Title: Sing Me to Sleep Pooh ; Description: A soothing alternative to a wind-up nighttime musical toy, this soft  plush sleeping Pooh, accompanied by his best friend Piglet, can be placed in a  corner of the crib and controlled by remote. Playing the music from a distance  means no more sneaking in to rewind a toy and possibly disturb the baby. Pooh is  dressed in a blue nightcap and snuggles on a small pillow, which is a plastic  music unit covered with cotton. It has a soft flashing light inside and there is  an on/off switch underneath. When pressed, Pooh's familiar voice sings a  lullaby. The blue plastic remote activates one of three choices--soft, tinkling  classical music, a Pooh song, or chirping birds and nature sounds. Parents will  need to decide if the hard plastic pillow unit is a safe choice for their child.  The unit comes with three AA batteries, but three more are required for the  remote.--Marianne Painter ;
