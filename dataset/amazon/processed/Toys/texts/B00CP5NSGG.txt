Title: The Hubsan X4 (H107L) ; Description: Let go of the sticks, and the X4 is to stable flight.

The X4 's micro size makes it pocket-portable for indoor flight virtually anywhere, yet its quad-rotor thrust makes it powerful enough to fly outside. 
Blue LED lights built into the rugged body illuminate the way, and the included micro LiPo battery delivers plenty of power and recharges quickly.

The HUBSAN X4 is completely ready-to-fly

The 2.4GHz Transmitter includes a full complement of tuning features and offers the unbeatable convenience of "no channels, no crystals" 2.4GHz technology-and that's just the beginning. 

Each time the transmitter and X4 are powered on, the transmitter automatically binds to the helicopter. 
Switching between Normal and Expert mode is as easy pressing the right control stick. A bright LED light provides information on the fly, indicating binding status and Normal or Expert mode. 
Trim adjustments are quick and easy thanks to the LCD screen and digital trim adjustment buttons.
Li Po-Power for Maximum Flight Time.
