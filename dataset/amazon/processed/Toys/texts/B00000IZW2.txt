Title: Colorforms Silly Faces Stick-Ons Game ; Description: How many times have you said, "Your face will stick that way"?  If you've tried to discourage your kids from sticking out their tongues or pulling on their cheeks, try redirecting their face-making energies to the Colorforms Silly Faces Game. The object of the game is to assemble an indescribably silly Colorforms face on the blank character card. Give the spinner a whirl for the type of feature--eyes, nose, mouth, hat and hair, and ears. Pick the piece that's just right and then place the item on your character--it sticks like magic. The first person to complete a face wins the game. No reading is required, so once kids understand the rules they can play independently.--Lisa Whipple ;
