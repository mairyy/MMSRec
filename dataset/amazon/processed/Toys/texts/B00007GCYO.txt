Title: Silly Soccer Game ; Description: This crazy soccer game is the perfect introduction to team sports for preschoolers. The plastic goal is sized just for smaller people and the miniature soft foam ball is easy on little feet. A goofy talking goalie is built right into the goal posts to shout out encouragement and challenges so kids can improve their game. The goalie wiggles back and forth as kids try to score and does some lighthearted trash-talking with expressions such as "Try and get it past these moves," and "Kick that thing in here." When kids score a goal, they are rewarded with cheering crowd sounds and congratulatory remarks from the goalie, such as "Nice shot, kid!" along with a response from the ball itself. An easy-to-operate ball release lever sends the ball down the goal's ramp and out on the lawn for more soccer playing. The goal operates via four "C" batteries (not included) and requires some help from adults to get it assembled.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
