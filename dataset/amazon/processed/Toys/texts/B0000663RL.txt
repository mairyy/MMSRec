Title: Scrambled States of America Game Card Game ; Description: The 50 United States of America have traded places so they could see another part of the country.  Now they need your help to find their way home!  Players are dealt 5 State Cards that they will try to match to the card turned over from the Scramble Card deck.  Scramble Cards have clues on them that relate them to other states, such as, a state that touches at least 6 other states or a state that has 4 or more syllables.  If a player can match a State Card from their pile to that Scramble Card, they'll slap their State Card and yell out the state's name. That card then goes into their Home Pile, and a new Scramble Card is turned over for the next round.  Whoever has collected the most State Cards in their Home Pile by the end of the game, is the winner!  This exciting card game is a great way to enrich basic knowledge of U.S. Geography.  Players will learn everything from state capitals and nicknames, to the shape and location of each state.  Game includes 50 State Cards, 50 Scramble Cards, 4 illustrated maps of the USA (11.5 x 6.5) and game instructions.  For 2 - 4 players, ages 8 and up. ;
