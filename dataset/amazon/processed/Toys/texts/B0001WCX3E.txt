Title: Fisher-Price: Elmo's Sing &amp; Teach Table ; Description: Get ready to learn shapes, colors, numbers, letters, face parts, animal sounds, and more with Elmo, Big Bird, Cookie Monster, and the rest of the Sesame Street gang! This Sing & Teach Table features tons of buttons and other interactive gadgets that prompt fun lessons for babies and toddlers, all in the wacky, weird voices of the Muppets. (Presumably, tots are familiar enough with the characters to understand all the squeals and growls.) The semi-circular shaped plastic table stands 12 inches high, not counting the waggling Elmo head that presides over the action. Children sit or stand at the table, lifting the Cookie Monster head to learn about "open" and "closed," spinning a drum for the alphabet song, or picking up a cell phone to hear The Count soliloquize about numbers. Bright, cheerful, and noisy--just what the toddler ordered.--Emilie Coulter ;
