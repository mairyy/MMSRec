Title: Fisher-Price Tumble Time Tigger ; Description: Stuffed versions of Tigger, the madcap tiger from the Winnie-the-Pooh franchise, are awfully cuddly but since they just lay there they don&#x92;t go a long ways toward replicating Tigger&#x92;s manic energy, boundless enthusiasm. Fortunately, this tumbling version of Tigger provides plenty of bounce performing cartwheels and headstands in response to clapping or cheering. While he expresses himself, Tigger also belts out songs to add to the fun. We found Tigger to be impressively precise in his tumbling and capable of doing everything the box boasts. We also liked how he kept a nice steady pace as too much rapid gymnastics might frighten younger children.--Charlie Williams ;
