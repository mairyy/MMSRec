Same award-winning laugh-out-loud sketch, pass and guess party game fun where players simultaneously draw what they see, then guess what they saw to reveal hilarious and unpredictable outcomes, but now the outcomes can go even more sideways with up to 12 players and books in play. And, have you heard? Telestrations was voted Best Party Game by Boardgamegeek and Games Magazine, and the awards keep coming from parents and educators -- including Parents&#x2019; Choice, Dr. Toy's Top 10 Games, NAPPA, Creative Child, The National Parenting Center Seal of Approval, and TillyWig Laugh-Out-Loud winner. Casual, family, party and strategy gamers alike tell us Telestrations is the best new addition to their game collection, and game night. It&#x2019;s an engaging game that can be played over and over with many different ages and types of groups/gatherings. And no drawing skills required --really. ;
