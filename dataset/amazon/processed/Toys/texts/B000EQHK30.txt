Title: VTech - Smartville Alphabet Train Station ; Description: The Alphabet Train Station packs a slew of activities for preschoolers, usually found in a combination of toys, into one fun-filled set. Toddlers learn their alphabet by moving the train around or pressing letters on the track to hear the letter and object spoken. Letters light up on the display panel for additional reinforcement. When kids get tired of that, they can place one of the 18 plastic animals in the Smart Parts spot to discover which animal they are and the sound they make. Still looking for more? Preschoolers can attempt some composing on the five-key piano or work on telling time by turning the hands on the station clock. As a last resort, kids can ignore all the electronic bells and whistles and just have some good old-fashioned creative play with the animals, the train track, and the seven role-play pieces. As with many Vtech toys, the Alphabet Train Station makes a lot of repetitive sounds that kids love but can get on parents&#x92; nerves. Thankfully, there is a volume control for quieter play. The toy comes with three short-term "AA" batteries for immediate play out of the box and an automatic shut-off feature kicks in if the station is left untouched for a few minutes.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
