Title: Jungle Speed ; Description: Jungle Speed is the lightning-fast game of quick thinking and quicker reflexes. Your keen eye and swift hand will win the day, if you can stop laughing long enough to catch your breath. Jungle Speed seems simple enough, and everyone can be playing minutes after you deal out the cards. But once you start playing, the chaotic action will take all your concentration. Fifteen minutes later, the game will be over and you can all pause for air - but that just leaves you time to play again. Flip the cards, spot the matching symbols and grab the totem, but grab faster than your friends, or you'll be stuck with their cards. Dump your whole hand to win - if you can.  Jungle Speed is easy to learn and fast to play, with excitement and fun for families and friends of all ages. Spotting the matching symbols is challenging enough, but the entire game can change if you see one of the special cards appear. Then you'll find yourself looking for colors instead of symbols, grabbing for the totem out of turn, or otherwise scrambling to stay a step ahead of everyone else. Whether you find yourself surrounded by adult friends or trying to entertain a roomful of youngsters, Jungle Speed has enough thrills and hijinks to keep everyone laughing and having a blast, game after game. ;
