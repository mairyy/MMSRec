Title: Disney Sofia The First Magical Talking Castle ; Description: Disney Sofia the First Magical Talking Castle: Based on the hit new animated series from Disney Junior, Sofia the First. When Sofia becomes Sofia the First, a princess of Enchancia, she must adapt to an extraordinary life of royalty and learn how to be a princess - inside and out. Her lessons and adventures take place in many grand settings, one of which is the enchanting royal castle that she now calls home. The two-story play set not only offers traditional play opportunities but also adds fun interactivity to really bring the kingdom of Enchancia to life. When girls place Sofia or Clover the Rabbit on the castle's special base, they can "magically" hear 10+ phrases said in each character's voice. But that's just the beginning: bring in other 3-inch dolls and figures from the line (sold separately) to bring Sofia's world to life and unlock more than 35 phrases. Enter through the ornate purple doors that swing open and closed. Lounge on the chair in the living area or enjoy dining and dancing in the ballroom. Send Sofia up and down by clipping her to the banister of the staircase. Upstairs, Sofia can get her beauty rest or host a slumber party in the grand princess bedroom, or she can play hide-and-seek with Clover the Rabbit in his cozy window seat. Sofia can gaze out upon Enchancia and the castle gardens while standing on her balcony or enjoys a day of outdoor fun in the garden - just extend the castle's bottom level to reveal a grassy picnic area. Girls will love reenacting favorite scenes or imagining new adventures and lessons for the adorable princess-in-training. Collect all your favorite Sofia the First Dolls and Playsets to build the ultimate Enchancia kingdom (each sold separately). ;
