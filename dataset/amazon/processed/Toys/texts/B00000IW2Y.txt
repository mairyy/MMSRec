Title: Playskool Color Glow Flashlight ; Description: Kids won't be afraid of the dark with this heavy-duty flashlight by their beds. It looks just like the one you carry in your car, but it's made for kids. For one thing, it shines in white, green, or red light with the turn of a switch, and it has an automatic shutoff. If the bar underneath the handle isn't pressed down, the flashlight will shut off in 30 seconds. It also has a manual on/off switch, so kids can feel like they're in total control. Mom or Dad will need to help install the batteries with a screwdriver, but after that kids will be off to explore the darkest corners of the closets or on a jungle safari through the living room.--Lynne Sampson ;
