Title: Little Tikes Cozy Coupe ; Description: This sturdy plastic car gives toddlers and young preschoolers the basic thrills of a real car, while parents can relax, knowing that this cherry-red sports car can go only as fast as their kids' little feet can carry them. Children sit on a bench-style driver's seat and poke their legs through to the ground. When they start walking, the car begins to scoot. The front wheels swirl like stroller wheels, making them especially responsive to the steering wheel. The front dash features a pretend key with a Little Tikes key chain and a horn button that beeps when pushed. A small storage bin in back can carry traveling gear or simply a stash of road snacks. Approximately 35 inches tall, 25 inches long, and 16 inches wide.--Gail Hudson ;
