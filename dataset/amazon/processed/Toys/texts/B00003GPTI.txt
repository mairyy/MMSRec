Title: LeapFrog Original LeapPad Learning System from 2004 ; Description: This talking book comes with an interactive "magic pen" that works like a hand-held computer mouse pointer. Children can opt to turn the paper pages and listen to the story read with different voices for each character. Or they can interrupt the read-aloud session to play with the magic pen (permanently attached with a wire). They can point the pen tip to any word on a page and hear it pronounced, or touch a picture and hear a sound effect (such as "Strike one!" for the baseball bat). Very similar to the popularLiving Bookscomputer games, this 10-by-11-inch book is more portable than a home computer. Stories in this set includeLil's Loose Tooth,Richard Scarry's Best Word Book Ever, and Winnie the Pooh inA Sweet Good Morning. The set also includes a paper piano keyboard and map and human anatomy games.--Gail Hudson ;
