Title: Little Tikes: Electronic Sounds Pumper ; Description: Toddlers who spend a lot of time on a ride-on vehicle will delight in having this play gas pump for additional role-playing. The pump and nozzle are made of safe, lightweight plastic with a flexible rubber hose for "filling up" little vehicles. A pretend credit-card swipe area with keypad makes the pump look a lot like the one Mommy and Daddy use at the real gas station. The pump also makes six electronic sounds when any of the three large push-buttons are pressed--two car start-up noises, two fueling noises, and two car horn sounds. The pump operates on two AA batteries (not included) and is ideal when paired with Little Tikes's popular Cozy Coupe II car.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
