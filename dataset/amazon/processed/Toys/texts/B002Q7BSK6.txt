Title: 100 8&quot; Premium Glow Stick Bracelets (10 Color Mixed Assortment) ; Description: USglow Laboratories is always on the cutting edge of glow product design, and our 8" glow bracelets are no exception. Rather than settling with the industry standard bland 5 color assortment, USglow Laboratories bracelets are available in the widest color assortment anywhere including white, blue, green, purple, pink, red, orange, yellow, bi-colored blue/green, bi-colored blue/red, and bi-colored mix. Whether you're purchasing a mixed color assortment, or just your favorite colors, more color choices really does equal more fun when it comes to glow. But we didn't stop there, also included are 100 top quality injection molded bracelet connectors, 1 glow disc connector kit (for creating 1 glow ball, or 2 glow flowers), 5 triple bracelet connectors (for creating 5 triple thick bracelets), and 1 glow glasses kit (for creating 1 pair of glow glasses). Don't settle for the economy grade glow products available elsewhere that will often be older stock, have a high percentage of duds, lower glow brightness, shorter glow duration, and limited color selection. Only when you buy premium quality USglow Laboratories brand glow products can you rest assured you're receiving the absolute best quality glow products. We take many extra steps to assure our premium quality, including extensive quality control checks, labels that include Date of Manufacturer and Best by Date under the factory sealed shrink wrap, and protective bubble wrap sleeves encasing the product, ensuring our premium quality stays that way until use. All USglow Laboratories glow products are non-toxic, non-heat generating, non-flammable, non-radioactive, certified phthalate free, and comply with the 2010 child safety CPSC requirements. These 8" long, 5mm diameter glow bracelets are the perfect addition to any night time event or party. ;
