Title: Hasbro Star Wars Darth Vader Voice Changer ; Description: With just the donning of this helmet you too may command the powers of the Dark Side! Or, at least, you&#x92;ll take on the role of the most&#xA0;notorious scourge the Jedi have ever known: Darth Vader. Once you&#x92;ve put on this perfect replica of Vader&#x92;s trademark&#xA0;mask&#xA0;and chest plate you&#x92;ll find yourself in command of not just his tell-tale breathing and five actual movie quotes but also the ability to speak in Darth Vader&#x92;s menacing voice. The helmet&#xA0;itself is constructed of hard plastic and can be adjusted to comfortably fit children to young adults (though older adults may be unable to get the mask on). The attached chest plate lets you command the sound effects with just the touch of a button. This unit not only comes with full instructions but also batteries so you&#x92;re ready to go right out of the box.&#xA0;In no time you'll be striking fear into the hearts of do-gooders everywhere!--Chip Quinn ;
