Title: Ball Bounce &amp; Sport Fun Hopper (colors and styles may vary) ; Description: Every child knows this much about evolution: somewhere, way, way back,  we were kangaroos. All you need to satisfy the deep primal desire to get around  by hopping is one of these big, heavy-gauge vinyl hopping balls. The slightly  stippled surface of the blue vinyl provides plenty of grip, the ball  inflates to over 44 inches in circumference which is about 14" diameter, so it can accommodate different  sizes of human Roo. The hopper grows from 14" to 15" within 30 to 60 minutes after inflation. The best feature of this model is a large, solid,  arch-shaped handle so that you can hang on across long stretches of rough  outback. A pump is required.--Richard Farr ;
