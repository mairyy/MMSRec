Title: The Famous Fart Whistle ; Description: What's funnier than the sound of a fart? Well a lot of things actually, but for those of us that haven't risen above second grade humor it might as well be Shakespeare. I laugh every time I blow into my fart whistle. In fact I have laughed so hard I actually swallowed one. You should hear me talk now. ;
