Title: Ravensburger Labyrinth ; Description: The aMAZEing Labyrinth uses a clever board design to create a  series of ever-changing mazes that one to four players must move  through. The object of the game is for each player to collect as  quickly as possible all seven treasures depicted on their individual  treasure cards. To add to the challenge, players know what the next  treasure is only after they find the one before it. Before each turn, a  maze card is pushed into the maze in a strategic place, helping the  player make his or her way to the prize. This means that the entire  maze shifts and changes on each turn, confounding some and helping  others. Players will need to think ahead to choose just the right spot  to shift the maze in their favor. This is an excellent game to get lost  in. A simpler version can be played by younger children.--Lee  Strucker ;
