Title: Exotic Car - Shake &amp; Go Racers ; Description: Perfect for younger racing fans, these great little Shake & Go cars require minimal coordination skills to operate. Kids simply shake the cars up and set them down on the ground to speed away. Cars can travel up to 20 feet away and work on most surfaces, from sidewalks to carpet, or on the Shake &#x91;n Go Speedway (sold separately) designed specifically for these vehicles. This slick yellow race car is one of five different collectible cars in the series and has its own unique startup and puttering engine sound. Parents, be forewarned, it doesn&#x92;t take much movement to set off the noise on these racers. The vibration of a real car motor can jiggle a Shake &#x91;n Go racer enough to produce revving noises from the trunk or bottom of a knapsack. This car is made of sturdy plastic and runs on three "AA" batteries (included).--Cristina Vaamonde ;
