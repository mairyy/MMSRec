Title: Disney Sofia The First Royal Tea Party Giftset ; Description: Disney Sofia the First Royal Tea Party Gift set: Based on the hit new animated series from Disney Junior, Sofia the First. When Sofia becomes Sofia the First, a princess of Enchancia, she must adapt to an extraordinary life of royalty and learn how to be a princess - inside and out. Along the way, she gets the guidance and support of friends, both old and new. One of her best friends is Jade and Sofia loves to spend time with her whenever she can. Girls can celebrate their special friendship with this tea-riffic play set featuring tea and treats for two. A regal table and two chairs (in purple and gold colors) set the perfect scene for a royal tea party; a teapot, two cups and a tray of snacks make up the goodies. Jade and Sofia 3-inch small dolls look adorable in sweet tea-party dresses. Articulation at the waist allows these two characters to both stand and sit at the table for proper princess tea. For a magical touch, the dolls also unlock phrases in Sofia the First's Magical Talking Castle, sold separately. Girls simply place the dolls on the "magic" base in the castle ballroom to activate. Collect all your favorite Sofia the First Dolls and Playsets to build the ultimate Enchancia kingdom (each sold separately). ;
