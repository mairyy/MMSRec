Title: Carcassonne: Traders ; Description: This second expansion takes Carcassonne to new dimensions of fun and excitement. Traders can earn players extra points and builders enable players to place extra tiles, allowing the cities and roads to grow faster. A pig, properly placed, can enrich the value of a farm. Also included is a small cloth bag for the tiles, making it easier to shuffle and draw them during the game. Traders and Builders is not a complete game, but must be played with Carcassonne. The expansion is designed for 2 to 6 players and takes about an hour to play. ;
