Title: Star Wars Signature Series Force FX Lightsaber w/Removable Blade - Obi-Wan Kenobi ; Description: With this official replica of Obi-Wan Kenobi's Lightsaber from Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith movie, you can pretend to be the Jedi hero himself! It looks and feels like a real Lightsaber, with a metal hilt, glowing blade, realistic light effects and authentic sound effects digitally recorded from the movie. The blade is removable from the hilt so that you can pretend to engage in Lightsaber duels when the blade and hilt are attached, or clip the hilt onto your belt and carry it the way the Jedi and Siih do in the movies. ;
