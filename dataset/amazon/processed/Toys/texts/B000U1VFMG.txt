Title: Radio Flyer Sport Coupe Red ; Description: Kids love riding in style in the Little Red Sport Coupe from Radio Flyer. This shiny red sports car will have your kids feeling like they own the sidewalk. The Red Sport Coupe features an electronic lights and sound dashboard. This car has a cup holder, a clicking key, clicking gearshift, and honking horn that make for wonderful play features. The door even opens and closes so kids will feel like this is the real thing. Sturdy chrome push handle is great for parents but goes down to resemble a rear spoiler when the child is in control. There is even storage room behind the seat, great for a jacket or sack lunch. When your child is ready to coast, they can slide their tired feet onto the innovative "stow away" footrest. ;
