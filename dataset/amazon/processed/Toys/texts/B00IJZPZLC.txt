Title: Marvel Guardians of The Galaxy Rocket Raccoon Figure, 6-Inch ; Description: Intergalactic bounty hunter Rocket Raccoon and his partner Groot are hot on the trail of their next big payday: the human known as Star-Lord! The Guardians of the Galaxy need all the help they can get to save the cosmos from destruction and this is your chance to build them a mighty ally! This 6-inch Rocket Raccoon figure looks just like Peter Quill and he's ready for battle with his laser pistol in his hand. But he also comes with the head and upper torso parts you need to build the plant-humanoid warrior Groot! Collect all 6 parts (other figures sold separately) and complete the hero's body! Then send your Rocket Raccoon and other figures (sold separately) into battle at his side. The action is epic when you build your own Groot figure!
