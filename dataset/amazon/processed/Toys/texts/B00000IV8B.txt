Title: Lacing Shapes ; Description: Lacing cards provide an inviting way for little ones to build the essential competence of hand-eye coordination, and these brightly colored shapes and laces make skill-building especially fun. Along with nine 36-inch laces, the set includes sturdy chipboard cards in the shape of a fish, a horse, a butterfly, a heart, an airplane, a gingerbread man, a triangle, a circle, and a square. Each card measures four to five inches at its widest diameter. One-inch tips on the laces make them easy to grip. The cards also double as tracing tools.--Joan DeClaire ;
