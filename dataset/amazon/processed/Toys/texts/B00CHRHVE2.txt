Title: Chutes and Ladders Board Game ; Description: Climb up and slide down in the exciting game of ups and downs, Chutes and Ladders. You and the character on your pawn can see the square marked 100, but it's not so easy to get there. If you land on a good deed, you can shimmy up a ladder, but land on the wrong spot and you'll shoot down a chute. Spin the spinner to see how many spots you'll move. Will your new spot send you down or move you up, up, up? Slip, slide and see if you can win at Chutes and Ladders. Chutes and Ladders and all related characters are trademarks of Hasbro. ;
