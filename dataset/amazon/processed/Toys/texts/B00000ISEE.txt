Title: Learning Resources Rainbow Bean Bags (6-Piece) ; Description: Sometimes the simplest toys have the most uses. This set consists of six 4-inch bean bags filled with tiny plastic pellets instead of real beans. Made out of thick canvas material with white zigzag stitched edges, each bean bag is a different brilliant rainbow color. An enclosed activity sheet suggests some simple learning games to identify colors and follow directions. These bean bags could also be used with special needs children or for total physical response activities with ESL students.--Marcie Bovetz ;
