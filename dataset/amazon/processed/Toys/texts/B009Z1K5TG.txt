Title: Transformers Generations Fall Of Cybertron Series 1 Soundwave Figure 6.5 Inches ; Description: Soundwave has spent centuries making himself indispensible to the Decepticon cause. His body is packed with electronic communications gear. He is capable of teasing even the faintest transmission out of the microwave background, cracking the toughest quantum code, and jamming the most powerful signal. Together with his minions, he is one of the most effective weapons in the Decepticon arsenal. This dynamic duo of Transformers figures will be your fiercest Decepticon villains yet. Your Soundwave figure converts from dangerous robot mode to communications truck mode so he can launch his sonic attacks. At his side is the spooky Laserbeak figure, who ejects from data disc mode at the touch of a button to auto-convert to robot mode. Together they&#x2019;ll make double trouble for the Autobots, and the outcome of the battle is all up to you. ;
