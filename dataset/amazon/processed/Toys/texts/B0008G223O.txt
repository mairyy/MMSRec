Title: LeapFrog My First LeapPad Alphabet Bus ; Description: Shaped like a friendly yellow school bus, this incarnation of My First LeapPad continues to engage children with fun games that they will never suspect are valuable brain-building activities. The updated LeapPad still accepts all of the 15 titles in the LeapFrog interactive library, each of which snaps into the LeapPad reader and focuses on a different pre-kindergarten skill, from reading to math to social skills. Secured to the bus is the "magic" pen, which hones fine motor skills when used to point to objects within the interactive books and, for more advanced learners, provides practice on how to hold a pencil and write letters. The difference with this First LeapPad, however, is that it has several early phonics activities built right in that do not require a book. The alphabet is listed along the side of the bus and children can touch a letter to hear its name said aloud. Two fun games ask children to identify a particular letter or letter sound and offer positive encouragement if kids don&#x92;t get the right answer the first time. Finally, preschoolers can listen to (what else?)The Wheels on the Busin between games. My First LeapPad comes with the interactive book and cartridge forLeap&#x92;s Big Dayand runs on four "AA" batteries (not included).--Cristina Vaamonde ;
