Title: Safety 1st Potty 'n Step Stool ; Description: This potty is exceptionally sturdy and comes assembled for use  as a standalone potty out of the box. Simply open the lid (and snap the  front shield into place if it's being used by a boy), then tilt the  seat up to reveal the bowl; it slides out for easy cleaning. When your  child is ready, you can remove the seat for use on the toilet, and the  arms provide extra security. Once the seat is removed, you can flip the  base out to form a step stool. Included is a booklet with tips on potty  training in English, Spanish, and French.--Terri Shea ;
