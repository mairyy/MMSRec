The big bubble was about the size of a small car!  For best big bubble results, we prefer the "two handled" bubble wand design like our Starter Wand and Pro Wand. We actually used a custom designed super-sized model of this type of wand to set our World Record!Beeboo is also excellent for parties - how would your kids like to stand inside a bubble?  Just fill a kiddie pool with bubble solution, and then use a hula hoop to draw a bubble tube up and around the lucky party guest.Beeboo is a terrific bubble mix refill!
