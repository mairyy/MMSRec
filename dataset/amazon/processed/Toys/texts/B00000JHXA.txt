Title: Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway - Henry the Green Engine ; Description: From the popularThomas the Tank Enginebook series and television'sShining Time Station, based on the Railway Series  by Rev. W. Awdry, comes Henry, the proud green engine. Made of hardwood, with  shiny green paint, a three-dimensional face, and a magnetically coupled coal car,  Henry is ready for hard work. Being one of the largest steam engines at Shining  Time Station, eight-wheeled Henry, also known as No. 3, can easily pull several  freight cars along with his 2-inch coal  car. Wheel axles measure 1 inch across and fit standard Brio wooden train  tracks, and similar 1- to 1.5-inch grooved train tracks. Train buffs young and  old will enjoy recreating authentic railway scenes as they collect these  wonderfully crafted, classic train cars, bridges, ramps, tunnels, stations, and  more from the Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends Wooden Railway System.--Kathryn Gustafson ;
