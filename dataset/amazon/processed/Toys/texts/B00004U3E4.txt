Title: Bruder Toys Roadmax Garbage Truck ; Description: Pretending to do the work of adults is a favorite pastime of  toddlers everywhere. With a realistic rear trash container and a front  cab that opens and closes, this sturdy Roadmax Garbage Truck makes it  easy for little ones to take on the role of the local garbage  collector. Sporting bright primary colors and oversize components with  smooth edges to prevent cuts and bruises, the garbage truck is made of  durable plastic and measures approximately 16.5 inches long and 9.5  inches high. The truck comes with a separate trash bin that can be  attached to the hand-powered lift on the back of the truck and then  dumped into the trash container. Once it's full, the truck driver can  lift the container and unload its contents at the dump. Equipped with  treaded rubber tires, the truck's front cab can be opened and closed  and is big enough to hold up to two action figures (sold separately).  Other Roadmax vehicles are sold separately.--Chris Burns ;
