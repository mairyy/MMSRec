Title: Transformers Universe Deluxe Class Classic Series Action Figure - Autobot Sunstreaker with Electron Pulse Blaster ; Description: SUNSTREAKER is a fighter for a cause, and that cause is SUNSTREAKER. If it's not in his best interest (and not too threatening to his paint job), he'll take out anyone he needs to, no matter where he is. Still, he'd rather be back home, kicking back, polishing his chrome and preparing for a good, old-fashioned arena fight, rather than hunting DECEPTICON assault squads across deep space.

Wielding an electron pulse blaster in robot mode, the loyal AUTOBOT defender is ready to take on whatever adventures you create! Convert the no-nonsense robot figure to vehicle mode to unleash a slick racecar and roll out! ;
