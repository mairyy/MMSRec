Title: Little Tikes Keyboard with Stool ; Description: Look out Elton John&#x97;here comes competition! Although made in child-friendly plastic and scaled down for smaller hands, this electronic keyboard operates just like a real one and is a fine choice as a first instrument. The keyboard has 37 keys for playing a wider range of songs and, similar to a piano, each key stroke plays a single note. With 8 different musical instruments, children have lots of opportunity for musical experimentation with everything from strings (violin, guitar) to wind instruments (saxophone, flute). The keyboard also offers 6 different drum sounds (tom, bass, snare, hi-hat, cymbal, and bell). Additionally, there are 8 different rhythms--waltz, rock, R&B;, house, pop, 16 beat, samba, swing&#x97;so kids can set the appropriate backbeat. Kids can adjust the tempo and volume incrementally with individual buttons and can refer to the 10 demo songs to get started on composing their own music. During performances, four lights on top of the keyboard flash during playing for better stage presence. The included microphone hooks onto the keyboard with a rack so one child can simultaneously sing and play or the microphone detaches to highlight one solo artist while another plays background accompaniment. The keyboard mounts onto a stand and comes with a comfortable stool. Four "C" batteries (not included) are required for its operation.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
