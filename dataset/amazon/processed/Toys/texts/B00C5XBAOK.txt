Title: Disney Sofia The First Royal Coach Playset ; Description: Disney Sofia the First Royal Coach Playset: Based on the hit new animated series from Disney Junior, Sofia the First. When her mom marries the King of Enchancia, Sofia must adapt to an extraordinary life of royalty - overnight.

With room for two 3-inch small dolls (sold separately), this magical, "flying" coach is the perfect princess accessory and the ultimate way to travel in royal style. A majestic white horse, adorned with a red "feather" and pretty wings, leads this open carriage.

As girls move the horse and carriage through the air, the horse's wings flap to mimic flight. Push the button to hear the coach play enchanting music that provides the perfect backdrop for reenacting favorite scenes from the Disney Junior series - or imagining new ones.
