Title: Playskool Step Start Walk 'n Ride Toy ; Description: When little wobblers are bored with walls and sofa edges, and  there's no one to offer a hand, they can two-foot it safely across that  open ocean of living-room floor with the help of the Step Start walker.  This dual-purpose toy acts as stable support as they learn to walk,  then lets them roll along when they want to ride. Once they are secure  on their legs, the walker converts easily to a first ride-on toy. (Only  adults can operate the wheel-lock mechanism.) A flexible antenna,  spinning drum, clicking gear, and other sight-touch-sound features  provide sit-down play fun. Assembly requires a Phillips screwdriver.--Ava Natov ;
