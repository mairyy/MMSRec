Title: 20Q (Colors May Vary) ; Description: The quest to fool the "artificial intelligence" of 20Q continues.  20Q is back with Version 2.0 that's "even smarter" and a fresh new look.  Players still think of something then answer a series of 20 questions until 20Q guesses what it is.  A new trans-reflective screen provides easy viewing, larger buttons make it easier to play and a backlight allows for more hours of play day or night!  New undo button allows you to change your answers! Colors may vary! ;
