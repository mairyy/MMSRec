Title: Crayola 20ct Washable Super Tips (5 Fun-Scented Markers Included) ; Description: Crayola's Washable Super Tips Fine Line set turns every kid into a graphic designer, illustrator, or just plain great colorer. These pens come in 20 pretty colors, with fine tips for drawing. Other fine-tipped pens can be frustrating for full-fledged coloring, but these have smooth sides that fill in coloring-book outlines quickly and elegantly. A great all-around pen with ink that washes off of skin and most fabric with hot water, but won't smear on the page. Comes in a nifty plastic pouch.--Claire Dederer ;
