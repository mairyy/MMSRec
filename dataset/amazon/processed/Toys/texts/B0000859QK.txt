Title: Radio Flyer Pathfinder Wagon&reg;, Red ; Description: Radio Flyer&#x92;s Pathfinder is the SUV of little red wagons, sporting a rugged plastic body and offering tikes a luxurious amount of towing or riding space. The wagon&#x92;s convertible seats fold down for maximum storage capacity and then flip up to comfortably accommodate two children. Webbed seatbelts ensure that children don&#x92;t bounce out when riding over rough terrain. The Pathfinder&#x92;s interior also has four built-in drink holders to keep sippy cups and juice boxes secure during the ride. The extra-long handle has a large, loop grip that even kids can control and that folds under the wagon for more compact storage. Like all Radio Flyer wagons, this one has heavy axles to handle a lot of weight, heavy-duty casters for making tight turns without tipping, and durable rubber tires that provide a soft, quiet ride. The Pathfinder measures 39-1/4 inches long, 19 inches wide, and 16-1/2 inches tall.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
