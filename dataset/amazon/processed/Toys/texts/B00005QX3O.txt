Title: MEGA Bloks Fill &amp; Dump Wagon ; Description: For the toddler who's just discovering construction toys, the Mega Blocks Wagon is a simple way to take building materials from site to site. Topped with a sturdy plastic handle, the wagon is just over a foot high and runs on four 6-inch plastic wheels. Inside are 25 assorted Mega Blocks. The side of the wagon has a row of Mega Blocks knobs, so grand structures can be created right on the top of the wagon.--Richard Farr ;
