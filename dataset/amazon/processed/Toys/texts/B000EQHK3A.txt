Title: 1-2-3 Treehouse - V.Smile SmartVille Imaginative Play ; Description: Smartville playsets are clever electronic toys that, on their surface, don't look like electronic toys. They're colorful plastic with cute characters that engage a toddler's imagination and tickles their fancy. Switch it on, and the playset comes alive with light-up buttons, songs, and encouraging words. This large 1-2-3 Treehouse playset teaches kids shape and number recognition. It features a fold-down pad of numbered buttons arrayed in a hopscotch grid and announces each number when its button is pressed. Even though the power switch has settings for "Discovery" and "Learning" modes, we couldn't find any distinction between the two; both modes occasionally prompt the child to find a number or shape. The playset has a couple built-in "hotspots," which are slots kids can plug characters and some props into to hear the set identify the piece by name or otherwise react with clues about what kind of animal the character is, such as "I like to swim." It even recognizes some characters from other Smartville sets. Parents will be glad to know that the playset has two volume settings and an off switch. An auto shut off feature conserves batteries when children wander away and forget to turn it off. Inside the box you'll find the playset, eight smart characters, four shape sorter pieces, a shape sorter house, two detachable fence pieces and instructions. It's powered by three AA-size batteries, which are included.--Porter B. Hall ;
