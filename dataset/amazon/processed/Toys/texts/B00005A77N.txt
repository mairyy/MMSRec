Title: Little Tikes Discover Sounds Workshop ; Description: This electronic activity workshop is all play and no work! Children will enjoy the colorful shapes and the sounds it makes as they explore its many fun projects. If they use the pretend hammer to hit one of the three shapes on the bench they'll hear silly cartoon-type "boings" and "brrrings." Two different ball drops let them "drill press" or pound balls through holes and into bins. There's also a shape sorter, a clicker ruler for number counting, and a put-and-take door. Workshop includes 13 accessories, and requires two AA alkaline batteries (not included). ;
