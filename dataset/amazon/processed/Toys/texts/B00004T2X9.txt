Title: Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Diesel 10 ; Description: Good is always balanced with evil, and in the case of the movieThomas and the Magic Railroad, Diesel 10 is a truly icky bad  guy. Teamed with sidekicks Splatter and Dodge, Diesel 10 is a renegade  engine on the Island of Sodor out to destroy the harmony of Sir Topham  Hatt's Railway. To intensify this train's nastiness, Diesel 10--on a  scale of 1 to 10--is rated 10 for devious deeds and brutal strength.  Measuring 4.25 inches long, Diesel 10 has two sets of wheels that  swivel, helping this extra-long train negotiate the tracks. Equipped  with a mischievous expression, Diesel 10 is pea green and--just like in  the movie--has a claw-like arm on top to help create havoc. As with all  Thomas the Tank Engine Learning Curve products, Diesel 10 is made of  hard maple and has two magnets on each end to allow your child to  expand their set.--Diane Tuman ;
