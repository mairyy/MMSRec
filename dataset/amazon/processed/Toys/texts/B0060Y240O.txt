Title: Nerf N-Strike Rayven CS-18 Blaster ; Description: Are you ready for some serious night action? You will be with the Rayven CS-18 blaster! The acceleration trigger on this 18-dart blaster lets you fire off your whole clip with semi-automatic speed, and like most N-Strike blasters, the Tactical Rail lets you add Tactical Rail accessories (sold separately) for more battle capability. But the Rayven CS-18 blaster also has the Firefly Tech clip that adds glow-in-the-dark power! The clip charges the included glow-in-the-dark Clip System darts so that every round you fire leaves a glowing trail behind! Watch your darts streak toward your target and collect them more easily when the mission is done. Power up your Rayven CS-18 blaster and get ready to take out your targets, even after dark! ;
