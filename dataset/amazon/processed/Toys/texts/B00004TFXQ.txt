Title: Learning Resources Cash n Carry Wallet ; Description: Money makes the world go round--make yours spin a little faster  with a wallet full of ersatz cash! This set includes 30 play bills in  various denominations; 40 plastic coins that are close replicas of  quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies; a cash card; and a surprisingly  (or perhaps, for parents, an alarmingly) realistic Citibank Visa card.  The wallet is a functional green-and-blue nylon foldover design, 5 by  4.5 inches closed, with lots of space for bills, coins, and cards. The  U.S. presidents on the various notes are just about recognizable, but  not named. A fun game would be to identify them by comparing them with  the real bills (or Bills).--Richard Farr ;
