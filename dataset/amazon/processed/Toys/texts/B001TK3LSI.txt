Title: Transformers  Voyager Demolisher ; Description: DEMOLISHOR isn&#x2019;t very bright, but he knows when to fight, and when to run and hide. Arriving on Earth to find MEGATRON destroyed, hiding seemed like the best option. Since then, he&#x2019;s taken a few smaller DECEPTICONS under his protection, and built quite a little community. It hasn&#x2019;t been easy, hiding among the humans that creep like a disease over this planet, but he and his companions are content to wait until a new DECEPTICON leader emerges to guide them back to glory. ;
