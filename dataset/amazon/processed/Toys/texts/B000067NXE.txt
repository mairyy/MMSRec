Title: Melissa &amp; Doug Deluxe 50-piece Wooden ABC/123 Blocks Set (colors may vary) ; Description: With all the high-tech electronic toys available for kids today, it would seem that the basics would be long forgotten. However, often the classic toys are the ones children want to play with the most. This classic block set includes 50 solid wood 1-inch-square blocks that are ideal for stacking or building. Two sides of each block feature carved letters or numbers in bright primary colors for teaching the alphabet or counting during play. The other four sides feature stamped letters, numbers, or pictures for additional practice in identification. Blocks come in a hard plastic storage case with a cord handle for easily transporting to Grandma&#x92;s house. This block set will most likely become the most used toy in the playroom.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
