Title: Tedco Discovery Pak ; Description: Whether your kid is a science whiz or simply curious about the physical world, this variety pack--which includes a Chandler Gyroscope, a Crystal Light Prism, and a Magna-Trix set--can lead to hours of fascinating discoveries. The gyroscope is a precision instrument that spins like a top on a tiny pivot, seeming to defy gravity just to keep its position in space. An easy-to-read product insert explains how to make the gadget spin on a tabletop, on the edge of a cup, or even on a tautly pulled string. The 2.5-inch-long light crystal can be used to separate white light into a rainbow of colors or to create a periscope for looking around corners. With the Magna-Trix set, which comes with a collection of three disc-shaped magnets arranged on a special stand, you can learn to make magnets float in space. The package includes notes about scientific discoveries through the use of similar instruments.--Joan DeClaire ;
