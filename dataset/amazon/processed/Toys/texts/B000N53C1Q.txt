Title: Folkmanis Ragdoll Cat Hand Puppet ; Description: Snuggle up with this furry, floppy realistic feline. This Ragdoll Cat puppet from Folkmanis is true to its breed. With relaxed paws and a long Fluffy tail, it looks almost boneless. Put side by side with a real live Cat and it would be hard to tell the difference. It's made of long, chocolate tipped plush with white markings. Ideal for use in interactive stage and puppet theater, Folkmanis Puppets are also great for teaching, daycare, school, pretend play, games and parties, or to pair with a book for storytelling. Easy to feed and care for, just add lots of love and snuggly fun. This puppet measures 28 x 7 x 7 inches (LxWxH). Folkmanis has been encouraging young imaginations to blossom since 1976 with its innovative and engaging specialty puppets, promoting creativity and discovery while winning nearly every industry, child development, and kid-tested award. Folkmanis has grown to become the premier manufacturer of plush puppets worldwide, offering over 200 of the most heartwarming and realistically designed creatures--both exotic and familiar--on the market today.
