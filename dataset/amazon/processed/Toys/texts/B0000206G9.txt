Title: Megaland ; Description: A landscape of tunnels and hiding dens can instantly be  assembled in your yard or family room with this compact modular play  structure. One of the best features is the abundance of colorful balls  (there are 50!). Pile them all into one cube and children can  experience the feel of a small-scale ball room like the ones in  commercial play areas. When children tire of burrowing, crawling, and  hiding, they can use the balls to shoot hoops into the built-in basket.  The pop-up nylon play structure is easy to assemble, but be careful  while assembling--modules spring open quickly. The challenge is folding  it back into the carrying cases (no careless cramming--adults will have  to follow instructions carefully). Megaland works with other PlayHut  structures. The set includes one large hut with basket, one medium hut,  one small block, two tunnels, two carrying bags, and 50  balls.--Gail Hudson ;
