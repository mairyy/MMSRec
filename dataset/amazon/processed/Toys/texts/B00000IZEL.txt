Title: Pressman Toys Topple Game ; Description: Topple is a three-dimensional board game for the whole family. To play,  perch the game board (a five-level, 8-inch square of molded plastic) on top of the 7-inch- high stand, choose your color piece, and agree on what score will win. Each player then  rolls a die and must place a piece on the game board level that corresponds to the number  rolled. Points are scored by completing rows or building high stacks. The round ends and  you get a point penalty if you send pieces cascading off the platform--that is, cause a  topple. Younger children can play without scoring, with players being eliminated as they  cause topples.--Richard Farr ;
