Title: Kick &amp; Play Piano with Music, Sounds &amp; Twinkling Lights ; Description: This soft, fabric-covered keyboard is alive with color, lights, sounds, and friendly animal faces.  Its three settings allow newborns, infants,andtoddlers to enjoy this magical, musical toy as they  develop strength and dexterity. Use the easy-attach straps to mount the Kick and Play Piano to your infant's  crib. The soft piano keys respond to your baby's natural kicking motion or light touch with dancing  star-shaped lights and a medley of 10 different songs. The soothing sounds of familiar tunes make it a perfect  bedtime companion, too. Automatic shut-off ensures long battery life and a peaceful rest after play. As your  baby grows, adjust the piano to the second setting for animal sounds, drumbeats, and musical verses. Or,  set it on the floor and switch to the third setting so your child can play it like a real piano with musical  chords. The colorful fabric cover slips off easily and is machine washable (music to parents' ears). Requires  three AA batteries, not included.--Melissa Wilson ;
