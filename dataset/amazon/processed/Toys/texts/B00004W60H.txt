Title: STARE! JUNIOR Game - 2nd Edition ; Description: Furrowed brows and hearty laughter are the most likely outcome of this fun but challenging game from Game Development Group. Just like its elder edition, the object of Stare! Junior is to be the first to reach the end of the game board. "Been there, done that," you're thinking? But in this game, looking hard and paying attention to detail are two things that will help players move forward. Individuals or teams stare at an image on a card for 30 seconds (more challenging games can be played by shortening the time) and then answer questions about what they saw. It's not easy--just try to remember what color socks the person next to you on the bus was wearing this morning, or how many people were reading magazines. Of course, you weren't staring...--Rachel Radway ;
