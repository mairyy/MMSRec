Title: Bruder MB Sprinter Fire Engine with Ladder, Water Pump, and Light/Sound Module ; Description: The newest Bruder Fire Engine is a slightly smaller truck than the Man Fire Engine with Water Pump, and Light and Sound Module #02771. This fire truck appeals to fire stations everywhere needing to get into back alleys and narrow streets. The Sprinter has great mobility for those hard to reach places. Special attention was paid to the foldout turntable ladder with rescue basket and the fully functioning water spray including visible water tank and lifting cylinder. Snap-down stabilizers, various tool bins and the signal horn and light that function just as in real life complete the all around fun factor that this vehicle has to offer. ;
