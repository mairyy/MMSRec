Title: Hohner HAG250P 1/2 Sized Classical Guitar ; Description: Hohner welcomes you to the world of playing guitar. The Hohner HAG250P is a handcrafted classical guitar with an Agathis top back and sides. This wood match-up creates a crisp texture to the overall sound of the instrument. The smaller scale of this instrument (considered 1/2 sized) is specially designed with the younger player in mind and is highly recommended for the players that are starting between the ages of 5-9. This instrument also comes equipped with light gauge nylon strings for easier fingering as to not discourage the first time player. Hohner has a long tradition of supporting music education. While being in business for over 150 years Hohner has enjoyed creating instruments to help people of all ages express themselves through music. Most recently Hohner has joined forces with GAMA, an organization dedicated to bringing the joy of playing guitar into school systems nationwide.
