Title: LeapFrog LeapStart Learning Gym ; Description: This interactive learning toy will grow along with your infant. There are two modes: one for infants and "lie-down" play and the other for older babies and "sitting-up" play. Lie-down play consists of a musical mode and a learning mode. In learning mode your baby can listen to the "Hello World Song" sung in five languages while watching the bright primary colors of the motorized mobile whirling away. In music mode your baby will hear over 10 minutes of music from around the world. For sitting-up play, detach the mobile and your child will be ready for some of the following hands-on learning activities: spin the world ball to hear "hello" in five languages, play peek-a-boo with the mirror, spin the animal roller to hear animal names, colors, and counting. These same buttons will play songs in the music mode, the most impressive of which was the world vocal chorus we heard when we opened the mirror. Thoughtful and engaging, this toy should hold your child's interest for a long time. Requires four "AA" batteries (not included).--Megan Sullivan ;
