Title: Family Pastimes / Secret Door - An Award Winning Co-operative Mystery Game ; Description: Winner of the 1992 Parents' Choice Award, this is a game to challenge budding detectives.  Players work against the clock to discover which three treasures are hidden behind a secret door.  The 12-inch game board illustrates a mansion setting, complete with a Dark Tunnel and an Observatory.  Small cards, depicting either valuables or clocks, are dispersed facedown across the board. Players turn over two cards at a time. If a clock is drawn, time is running out and thieves might get away with the three hidden treasures! Children will have fun testing their memories, cooperating with their teammates, and honing their detection skills with this game. With a little care, the cards will survive years of playing.--Wendy Slotboom ;
