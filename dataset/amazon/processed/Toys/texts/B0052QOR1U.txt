Title: Park &amp; Sun Portable Tetherball Set ; Description: Take some tetherball action with you everywhere you go with this Park & Sun portable tetherball set. The set is equipped with a sturdy 1-1/2-inch aluminum three-piece pole that stands 9 feet tall, along with an aluminum base that anchors to the ground with a 12-inch welded center spike and three 16-inch tripod arms. No need to pour cement or dig a hole to set up a fun tetherball game. Plus, the set's soft-touch tetherball is easier on the hands and forearms than most tetherballs, so you won't feel beat up after a competitive game. And the ball connects tenaciously to the pole thanks to the 7-foot nylon tether and easy-hook carabineer. Ready to move on? Simply collapse the tetherball set and store it inside the handy carrying bag. ;
