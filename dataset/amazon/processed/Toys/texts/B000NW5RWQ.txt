Title: Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium ; Description: The Soothing Seas Aquarium is a crib attaching infant soother that captivates baby with the mesmerizing effects of water. The wrap around design offers baby a better water view than ever before. Mama Fish has a realistic motion as she appears to be swimming through the water, followed closely behind by her baby. Their little crab friend plays peek-a-boo behind the coral as the seaweed sways gently in the waves. There is a light underneath the action and soothing blue lights fade on and off overhead. Lovely classical music plays one of 5 songs (or one of 3 sound effects) all the while bubbles rise upwards to the "surface". Up to 18 minutes of continuous musical play. 4 classical styled songs, 2 sound effects. 3 modes of use:1 = Sounds, Lights and Water/Swimming Motion. 2 = Sounds & Lights. 3 = Sounds only. There is a remote control which activates the soother from the doorway. Fits most standard cribs. ;
