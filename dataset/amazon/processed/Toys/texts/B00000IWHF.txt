Title: Aggravation ; Description: Grrr! Getting aggravated yet? Aggravation is the classic marble race around a star shape, from base to home sweet home. It's always tempting to take a shortcut, but beware! An opponent might be waiting for just such an opportunity to aggravate. By landing on another player's marble, anyone can send that marble back to its base to start over. And this could be a serious setback, since the object is to get all four marbles back home before the others do. Each player rolls the die and moves a marble around the board, choosing along the way whether to aggravate another player, take a shortcut (or super shortcut!), or just try to quietly slide by (good luck with that approach!). The game includes 24 marbles, 18.5-by-18.5-inch game board, die, and instructions. For two to six players.--Emilie Coulter ;
