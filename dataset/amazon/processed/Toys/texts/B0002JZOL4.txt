Title: Envision High Chair in Cumberland Plaid ; Description: This basic, no-frills high chair is cost-efficient to purchase as a second chair for Grandma&#x92;s house or a back-up chair for visiting babies. Baby is contained within the Envision high chair with a three-point restraint. With seven height adjustments, baby can be raised or lowered to meet the level of the table, and three reclining positions get infants in the right position for first feedings. The slide-on tray moves in to four different positions but doesn&#x92;t always get close enough to prevent major spills. Any food that misses baby will land on the seat cover, which is fully washable for easy cleaning. It is safe to place food directly on the dishwasher-safe insert nestled on top of the tray although it is a bit difficult to remove the insert for washing. A bar underneath the tray releases it from the high chair when pulled and often requires two hands. Rolling casters make this high chair easy to move around the room and folding legs close the chair up for storage until it is next needed. This is Evenflo&#x92;s entry-level high chair model; subsequent models offer a few more features. This version is covered in the tasteful Cumberland pattern, a combination of two different plaids in pale blue hues.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
