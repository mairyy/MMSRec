Title: K'NEX Education - Intro To Simple Machines: Gears ; Description: Sprocket Gears! Spur Gears! Rack & Pinion! And More! The K'NEX Education Intro to Simple Machines: Gears set is designed to introduce students to the scientific concepts associated with gears. Students are provided with the opportunity to acquire skills using a hands-on, inquiry-based approach to information and concepts as they build, investigate, discuss, and evaluate scientific principles in action. The Teacher's Guide provides the information and resources needed to build students' understanding of scientific concepts and channel their inquiries into active and meaningful learning experiences. Extension activities to explore the concepts more deeply are also included. Set includes 198 K'NEX parts &#x2013; enough to build 7 fully-functioning replicas of real-world machines, one at a time. Supports 2 &#x2013; 3 students working as a team. Grades 3 -5. Building instructions and comprehensive teacher's guide aligned to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Standards included. Packaged in a strong storage tray with snap-on lid.  STEM Education focuses on science, technology, engineering and mathematics concepts taught through problem-solving, discovery, exploratory learning and critical thinking. STEM Education requires students to be active participants in the learning. K'NEX models offer hands-on learning opportunities that encourage scientific inquiry, investigation and experimentation. Our inquiry-based lessons challenge students as they build, investigate, problem solve, discuss, and evaluate scientific and design principles in action. Aligned to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math standards.
