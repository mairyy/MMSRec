Title: My Scene Goes Hollywood Chelsea Doll ; Description: City-slicking and super-savvy, the dolls from the My Scene gang exude coolness and have total street cred with the &#x91;tween set. This Chelsea doll is designed after her cartoon counterpart in the DVD movieMy Scene Goes to Hollywood, where the gang are all cast as extras in a glamorous Hollywood movie. Dressed for the red carpet, Chelsea wears a shimmering handkerchief-hemmed camisole, sparkly green pants, and a pink fur-trimmed coat. Platform heels, distinctive jewelry, and movie-star shades complete her look. Chelsea&#x92;s accessories include a director&#x92;s chair, a laptop, movie magazines, popcorn, and a wardrobe trunk filled with various cosmetics and jewelry. Chelsea also comes with a second outfit that lives up to her newfound celebrity status: a pink halter dress with a matching wrap and lace-up ballet flats. Although geared to kids as young as 6 years old, some parents may deem the clothing and makeup on these dolls to be a bit risqu&#xE9; for younger children.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
