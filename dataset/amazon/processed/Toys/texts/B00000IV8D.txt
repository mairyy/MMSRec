Title: Lauri Shape &amp; Color Sorter ; Description: Circles, squares, triangles, hearts, and stars! Little ones will delight in their ability to sort and stack these colorful, spongy shapes on glossy wooden pegs. The Shape and Color Sorter helps preschoolers and kindergartners learn the essential skills of hand-eye coordination, shape and color recognition, and sorting. Brightly colored and fun to touch, the 25 crepe rubber pieces are nearly indestructible. In fact, this set exceeds standards set by the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission. Still, the product is not meant for children who may put objects in their mouths. Comes with a 3.75-by-11.5-inch base panel and five removable "punkin-head pegs."--Joan DeClaire ;
