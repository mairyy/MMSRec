Title: Fisher-Price Baby Playzone Kick and Whirl Carnival ; Description: Babies will get a real physical and mental workout with this play gym. It's pretty much like all of the other models out there, but its stand-out is its versatility and diversity of features for infants at all stages. A kicking gym for infants is made of attractive objects than spin, light up, and make sounds with each tiny foot-fall. A Ferris wheel loaded with colorful balls spins overhead to create additional interest. Babies who can sit up can spin the Ferris wheel themselves, and watch it release the five balls down a tunneled ramp and out the side of the gym. This in turn sets off music and lights as the balls zip past noisy, spinning obstacles. It's not just fun and games, though: the activities are designed to develop motor skills, cognitive learning, and stimulation of the senses.Diane Beall ;
