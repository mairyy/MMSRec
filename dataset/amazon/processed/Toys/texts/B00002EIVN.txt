Title: Naturally Playful Kangaroo Climber ; Description: For toddlers who aren't quite ready for a belayer and harness at the climbing  gym, there's plenty of indoor/outdoor fun to be had with the Kangaroo Climber. Six  modular, plastic pieces--each a different color and about 30 inches square--snap together  to form a step-n-slide play structure. It's ideal for the very small thrill-seeker. The walls  include a doorway, a crawling-hole, and smaller holes and notched steps to encourage the  ascent of Kangaroo's north, south, east or west faces. The top of the slide is nicely  framed by an archway. Crawl through, brace yourself, anddown you go!--Richard Farr ;
