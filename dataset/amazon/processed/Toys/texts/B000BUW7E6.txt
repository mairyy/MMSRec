Title: POOF-Slinky 0SA222 Scientific Explorer Disgusting Science Kit ; Description: The POOF-Slinky 0SA222 Scientific Explorer Disgusting Science is the grossest, most revolting kit available that will educate your child with nasty experiments on what actually grows on their own body, what's really in their teeth and the explanations behind our unmentionable, smelly bodily functions. Disgusting Science investigates your child's everyday questions like "What makes you pass gas?", "Do creatures really live on me?", "Why do your feet really stink?" and more. Your young scientist will be fascinated to learn fun facts about these body parts, by-products and will be grossed out as they take science to a whole new level by creating a stinky intestine, slimy snot, fake blood and learn how to grow friendly molds and bacteria. Each kit comes with (4) petri dishes, a magnifier, (4) cotton swabs, gelatin, sugar, baking yeast, red coloring, green coloring, a rubber balloon, small plastic bag and an activity guide. Find out how real science can be really gross, but so much fun in a disgusting new way.
