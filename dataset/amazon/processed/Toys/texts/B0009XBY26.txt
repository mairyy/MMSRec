Title: Gamewright Castle Keep, the Game of Medieval Strategy and Siege ; Description: Transport yourself to a time when protecting your possessions meant defending your keep, the most secure part of the castle. Keeps were often called "great towers" because of their imposing structure - walls over 10&#x2019; thick and 75&#x2019; high. They served various functions, from last resort strongholds during battle to sites of castle dungeons. While there are few remaining keeps still standing today, you can get a small taste of what it was like to build and defend a castle in this game that is simple to learn, yet full of strategy and decision-making elements that will challenge all ages. ;
