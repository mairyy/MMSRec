Title: LeapFrog Learning Band&trade; Walker ; Description: As seen in Child magazine's 'Best Toy Awards' issue! Baby's steps set the learning in motion! Push the walker and watch the red drum spin and the colorful organ pipes move up and down all in time to a marching band ABC song. Switch to music mode and hear a fun walk-along song that encourages baby's first steps. This walker can also be converted into a sit-at learning center for a 2-in-1 learning experience. With two ways to play, baby will have tons to learn and explore. In learn mode, spin the drum for an ABC song (when the drum stops, the song stops), turn the trumpet roller for an introduction to shapes and colors, or push the organ for a counting 1-5 song. In music mode, each activity offers real instrumental tunes and upbeat melodies with every spin, press and turn! The Learning Band Walker is full of moving instruments and real instrument sounds that reward those first steps and make baby leader of the band!  How does it work? * Music and moving instruments all start when baby pushes the walker!  * 2-stage conversion from floor toy to walker!  * Parent-set volume control (lets parents choose the volume level).  * Sturdy, wide base!
