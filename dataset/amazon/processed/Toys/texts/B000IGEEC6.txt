Title: Schoenhut 25-Key My First Piano II, Red ; Description: Schoenhut's bright red or white, 25-key tabletop is the perfect choice for a toddler's first piano. Both fun and educational. It is an ideal instrument to use for developing eye-hand coordination and encouraging musical creativity. Chromatically tuned, the lovely chime-like notes are produced by little hammers striking precision-ground, German steel music rods (versus the conventional taut wires used in full-sized models). Schoenhut's Learning System, with its play-by-color teaching method, makes playing simple and fun. A removable color strip fits behind the keys to guide small fingers from chord to chord. The chart also works on adult keyboards, since keys on Schoenhut toy pianos are of corresponding width. This teaches children proper "finger stretch" from the very beginning. The accompanying Songbook contains a collection of familiar tunes. This Learning System has been specially designed to build a child's confidence and develop basic playing skills.   Age Range: Three and up. ;
