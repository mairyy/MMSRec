Title: Fisher-Price Grow-to-Pro Golf Set ; Description: Fore! Fisher-Price bring you the Grow-to-Pro Golf set--perfect for any Tiger Woods in training. Set includes a snap-together golf bag, driver, putter, tee, and five golf balls--all in sturdy, easy-to-clean plastic. When your little putter (and the future Masters champion) pushes down the lever on the bottom of the bag with the end of the club, one golf ball rolls into position on the tee. Next stop--peewee tour! Adult assembly required; no special tools or batteries needed.--Margaret QuinnEND ;
