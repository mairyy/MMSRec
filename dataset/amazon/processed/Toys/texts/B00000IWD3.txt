Title: Don't Wake Daddy ; Description: Shhh! If you can sneak past sleeping Daddy without waking him, you can have that midnight snack you're craving. But it's going to be tough--there are roadblocks everywhere. Don't step on the cat's tail!  And watch out for those roller blades that didn't get put away! The first person to slip around all these obstreperous obstacles to get to the fridge wins. Players spin a spinner to determine what color space they'll move to. If the player's card doesn't match the picture on the space, Daddy's alarm clock button must be pushed the number of times indicated. Just hope that Daddy will sleep through the alarm. If not, he'll pop up and make his nightcap fly off! The game includes "Daddy" in a 9-by-5-inch plastic bed, gameboard, mover bases, deck of cards, spinner, and instructions (English and Spanish). For two to four players.--Emilie Coulter ;
