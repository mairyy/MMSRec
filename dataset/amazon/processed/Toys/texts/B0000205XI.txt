Title: SKIP BO Card Game ; Description: A member of Mattel's popular family of Uno card games, Skip-Bo  resembles speed (or spit) in the same way that Uno takes after crazy  eights. Out of a 162-card deck, two to six players are each dealt  20-card "stockpiles"; the first one to deplete their pile wins. Competing  either alone or in teams, players draw from a central pile and stack  their cards sequentially onto one of four "build" piles (for example,  an eight onto a seven, a three onto a two), using plentiful Skip-Bo  wild cards to break up static situations. Deceptively simple and  ingeniously designed, this classic game offers plenty of strategizing  opportunities, or it can just make a nice backdrop to socializing and  munching on potato chips.--Paul Hughes ;
