Title: ScienceWiz Magnetism Experiment Kit and Book 22 Experiments, Magnetism ; Description: Get ready to explore magnetism right at home with theScienceWiz Magnetismkit. This great kit includes two stages of experiments:The large, color coded magnets should be played with first in Kindergarten. Try out the first 15 activities to explore which metals stick to magnets, magnetic poles, attract and repel, magnets through materials, and temporary magnets. Your child will draw with iron filings, discover what sticks to magnets, levitate and bounce rings, swim a duck, make a temporary magnet, detect iron, go fishing, and play with magnetic poles.Then sometime between second and third grade children should revisit this book, repeat their favorite activities, and do the more advanced projects in the second part of the book. Your child can then build an electromagnet and then flip the poles, construct a compass, visualize the lines of magnetic force, explore compass directions, and discover how motors work.Step-by-step instructions lead a child successfully through each activity. The full color illustrations present central scientific concepts which allow children to discover the "why" as well as the "how" of these great projects. Bring the fun and learning further by utilizing the animations that compliment the book on the ScienceWiz website to deepen and extend comprehension.The award winningScienceWizline got its start in 1995 when we released our first title ScienceWiz Electricity. Our line of science kits stemmed from Dr. Penny Norman's volunteer work teaching science in her children's elementary schools and her ScienceWiz after school and summer programs. With initial development supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and the Franklin Foundation, each of our kits is created with the goal of teaching fundamental scientific concepts to children through hands-on play. ;
