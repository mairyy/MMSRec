Title: Skullduggery Eyewitness Shark Casting Kit ; Description: What came first--the shark or the dinosaur? You guessed it, the shark. Did you know that the hammerhead shark is immune to a stingray's poison? The Eyewitness Shark Kit gives children hands-on learning about one of the most mysterious and feared creatures on earth. Inspired by the colorful photography in the Eyewitness book,Shark, this kit includes one shark tooth and everything you need to create painstakingly detailed molds of great white, thresher, and hammerhead sharks. The enclosed instruction booklet contains amazingly informative reading about each type of shark. Using the plasterlike PerfectCast molding material, kids cast their favorite shark, paint it, and then attach magnets to display their 7-inch masterpiece on the refrigerator. Parents will want to advise children that their painting efforts probably won't match the professionally rendered examples in the book.--Lisa Whipple ;
