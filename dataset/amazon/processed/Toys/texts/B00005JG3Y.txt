Title: Pass the Pigs ; Description: How's your tolerance for puns? You'll need some for Pass the Pigs, a  simple game of chance built around a pig theme. Instead of dice, you roll two  cute pink piglets, and you gain or lose points depending on how the critters  land. For example, if both land on all fours, called a "double trotter," you get  20 points; if they land lying opposite each other, called a "Pig Out," you gain  no points and cede your turn. There are a number of other rules as well as a  variation called "Hog Call." This would be a good travel game (the pigs,  instructions, and scoring pad fit in a small, tidy box) or a fine present for  someone who's, well, into pigs!--Elisa Murray ;
