Title: Little People Surprise Sounds Fun Park ; Description: Designed to encourage early role play, this small, colorful amusement park is centered on a roller-coaster track that winds around a sharp curve. When the roller-coaster car hits the purple star that hangs from above, a monkey drops into a dunk tank. ("Ooh-ee-ah!") Sonya Lee can ride the freestanding, two-person rocket ship, while Smiley the Clown collects tickets or listens to music coming from the twirling teacups. This would be a fun, developmentally rich toy for preschoolers. Required, but not included, are three AA batteries.--Andy Boynton ;
