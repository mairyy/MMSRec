Title: Twister ; Description: Over forty years old and going strong! Soon after its release in 1966, Twister was made instantly popular when Johnny Carson and Eva Gabor played it onThe Tonight Show. Such a simple concept, with so much potential for hilarity. The game includes a plastic mat with red, blue, yellow, and green spots; a spinner; and instructions. To play (as if you didn&#x92;t already know&#x85;), two to four players face each other, with the plastic mat in the center. A referee spins the spinner, then calls out the body part and the color the arrow points to ("Left foot, blue," "Right hand, yellow"). All players, at the same time, follow the directions, placing the appropriate body part on a vacant circle. Players become increasingly entangled, until someone (or everyone) finally topples, and is eliminated. The last person standing&#x97;er, crouching&#x97;wins. If this doesn&#x92;t bring families and friends (and celebrities) closer together, we don&#x92;t know what does! Out-and-out fun.--Emilie Coulter ;
