Title: HEXBUG Larva (Colors May Vary) ; Description: The Hexbug Larva is a micro robotic creature that slithers forward on smooth surfaces using a slow, rhythmic flexing motion. Just like real larvae, each of these creepy crawlers reacts to its environment, instinctively changing direction upon sensing an object in its path and wriggling off to explore a clear, undisturbed path ahead. Its behavior is eerily mesmerizing to watch and interact with. The Hexbug Larva is CPSIA approved for kids ages 8 and up.The Hexbug Larva features a forward facing infrared sensor that allows it to detect fellow squirming larvae and other objects in its path. When the Hexbug Larva encounters a road block, it spins around on two micro robotic wheels hidden beneath its hard exterior shell and heads off in a new direction. Three button cell batteries are included.  Color may vary. ;
