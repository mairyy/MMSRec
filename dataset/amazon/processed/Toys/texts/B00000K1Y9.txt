Title: Folkmanis Monkey Hand Puppet ; Description: Make a little monkey business with this gorgeous puppet, whose  thick, lush coat and tail are made of contrasting browns. The puppet's  hands, feet, ears, and face are made of a dark beige fabric, and his  nose is perched atop his oversize mouth, the inside of which is a darker  brown. Large plastic button eyes finish off his expressive face. The  puppeteer's hand is inserted through the bottom of the body, and fingers  fit in the upper arms and mouth. Wonderfully detailed, this monkey  puppet is 23 inches long and 8 inches wide. Surface washable with cold  water.--Peggy Etra ;
