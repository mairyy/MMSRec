Title: Tonka Toughest Mighty Truck (Handle Color May Vary) ; Description: While many classic toys are now mass-produced using cheaper materials (primarily plastic), this Tonka truck&#x92;s quality construction is preserved. Although the wheels and frame of this dump truck are made of plastic, it is of a heavy, durable weight and suitable for the muddy or wet territories that this truck is sure to encounter. The dump bed, however, is made of heavy-duty steel--just the way parents will remember this toy. This massive truck measures 18 inches long and is a hulking 11-1/4 inches tall with an enormous dump bed that can haul and dump overwhelming piles of dirt, cedar chips, or toys. A plastic handle on the front of the dump bed provides a sturdy grip for tilting the bed to drop a heavy load and ease the bed back to a horizontal position again. Rugged 6-1/2-inch tires enable this truck to scale (and potentially flatten) towering mountains of sand at the beach or rocky, mountainous terrain at the park. Tonka stand behind the durability of this toy by covering it with a full lifetime warranty.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
