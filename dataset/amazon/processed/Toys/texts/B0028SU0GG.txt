Title: Parker Brothers Jenga Max ; Description: Build it big, wide or tall but don't let it fall! This might just be the most nail-biting Jenga game you've ever played. The challenge is to hook or hang the blocks onto each other without upsetting the balance and maxing it out. Hang 'em straight up, straight out, or over the top, but don't hang one in the wrong spot, or it'll all fall down! Be the last player to successfully hang a block and you win the game! ;
