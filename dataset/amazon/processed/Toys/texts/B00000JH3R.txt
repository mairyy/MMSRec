Title: LEGO Duplo Green Building Plate (15&quot; X 15&quot;) ; Description: This 15-inch-square green base plate provides a building surface for anyDUPLOset. It is made of the same sturdy, impact-resistant plastic as other DUPLO toys, and has smooth, rounded edges. DUPLO sets are designed for use by toddlers (ages 18 months to 5 years), and have bigger pieces and more rounded shapes than traditional LEGO pieces, so they can accommodate the needs of younger users. If you are shopping for a baby, try the LEGO PRIMO sets, which are even bigger and easier to handle.--Katherine Ferguson ;
