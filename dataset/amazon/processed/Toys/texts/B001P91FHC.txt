Title: Calico Critters Furbanks Squirrel Family ; Description: Meet the citizens of Cloverleaf Corners!  Adorable Critters come with removable clothing.  Family critters are poseable, with jointed arms and legs, and heads that turn.  Parents are approx. 3" tall, and brothers and sisters are 2.25 inches tall.  The new Furbanks Squirrel Family loves acting and directing.  Mother Emma is always rehearsing her lines, while Father Kenneth is known for directing with a big booming voice and dramatic gestures.  Brother Douglas is in his own imaginary world of pirates, knights and dragons.  His sister Greta is the exact opposite of him - she is quiet and a perfectionist, especially with her acting.  Mix and match with other Calico Critters figures. ;
