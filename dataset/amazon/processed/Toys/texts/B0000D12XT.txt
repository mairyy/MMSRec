Title: Little People Playground ; Description: Designed to encourage early role play, this small, colorful playground is centered on a giant tic-tac-toe board, with rolling x's and o's, that sits atop a yellow, open-air sandbox. Michael can climb the ladder to the upper platform while Sarah Lynn goes down the red slide and giggles. Other fun features include a musical merry-go-round, a purple tire swing, and a yellow tricycle. This would be an entertaining, developmentally rich toy for preschoolers. Required, but not included, are three AA batteries.--Andy Boynton ;
