Title: Parrot Pile-Up Game ; Description: Parrot Pile-Up Game: Parrot Pile-Up is a pile of fun. Balance, nerve and a steady hand are required in this tropical-themed game of skill. Players carefully stack fruit and crates on a clumsy parrot's raft with a steady hand and give it a patient push to the next player. If the stack falls, the player doing the pushing gets more pieces. The first player to get rid of all his or her cargo wins. Difficulty can be moderated by tilting the raft or leaving it level to accommodate multiple levels of skill. Includes 1 parrot, 1 raft, 20 stacking pieces and 4 cards. ;
