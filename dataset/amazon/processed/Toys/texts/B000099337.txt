Title: Sing &amp; Discover Piano ; Description: Whether baby's a little bit country or a little bit rock 'n roll, the Sing & Discover Piano will bring out the music in every young child. Designed especially for little fingers and big curiosities, this colorful, interactive keyboard teaches animal noises, music styles, instrument sounds, counting and more. Baby can change the rhythm and tempo of a song with the easy-to-grasp joystick, or play along with the melodies on the padded drum.
