Title: Fisher Price Grow-with-Me 3-in-1 Skateboard ; Description: What&#x2019;s so cool about this skateboard? Three learn-to-skateboard stages for kids as young as 4! Stage 1 beginners start rolling with the removable handle attached and the height-adjustable skateboard deck set low to the ground for extra balance and stability. When they&#x2019;re ready, it&#x2019;s easy to remove the handle for Stage 2 hands-free skateboarding fun&#x2014;still with extra stability from the low board. And when they&#x2019;re ready to board like a big kid, it&#x2019;s on to Stage 3! Raise the deck to traditional skateboard height for more board action. It&#x2019;s easy to adjust from low to high, just slide the wheels! ;
