Title: Folkmanis Shark 22in Hand Puppet ; Description: If your little one has sailed into that stuffed-animal-crazy  stage, and is especially fond of things unusual, here's a lean and mean  Great White puppet that will keep things out of the doldrums. This bad  boy is about 22 inches long from conical snout to tail fin; he's got a  mouth full of scary-looking (but perfectly harmless) Naugahyde teeth.  He's made of soft gunmetal-gray polyester plush, with a light gray  underside. The puppet pocket is partly disguised by his pectoral fins;  swimming along your arm with his mouth agape, he makes a pretty  frightening sight for such a benign creature. Detailing--from his  embroidered gills to his steely dark eyes--is firmly attached, so he's  safe to let loose even with the youngest surfer dudes.--Julie  Ubben ;
