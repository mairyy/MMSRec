Title: Fisher-Price Little People Melody the Mini Van ; Description: Ready to run some errands? Kids will have a great time imitating a familiar experience (shopping with Mom) with Melody the Mini Van. Melody's a great little friend who "blinks" as kids roll her along. Her hatchback opens and closes, and Baby Ashley's stroller fits in the trunk. Best of all, when you press on the dashboard, you hear the song &#x201C;If you're happy and you know it&#x201D;, giggles and other fun sounds. ;
