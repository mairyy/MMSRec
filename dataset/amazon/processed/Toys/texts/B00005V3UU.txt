Title: VTech - V.Smile Pull n' Play Phone ; Description: Little ones love taking the call, and taking their phone from room to room. The Pull N' Play Phone lets babies practice making pretend calls to friends and family and receiving calls while they play. When a call comes in, the phone rings and puppy pops up with the receiver. The chunky keypad buttons teach numbers and counting as babies dial, while the receiver button flashes along to ten cheerful melodies and a cute sing-along song adds to the learning fun. ;
