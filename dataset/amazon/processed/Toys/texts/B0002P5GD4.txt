Title: Dora Explorer: Dora's Talking Dollhouse w/Lights, Sounds, Music &amp; Diego, Boots, Swiper - Exclusively at Toys&quot;R&quot;Us! ; Description: Raise the roof with Dora the Explorer! This huge dollhouse not only talks--it's bilingual! Unfold the sturdy plastic house to reveal several rooms, plus a second story upstairs. Press the picture frame to hear Dora talk about her family, or open the fridge to hear about how hungry she is. Six different accessories can be manipulated to produce more than 20 phrases or songs in both English and Spanish. The house is only partially furnished with built-in kitchen appliances and table, boom box and picture in living room, phone on one wall, mirror in bathroom, and miscellaneous illustrations of shelves in the bedrooms. Dora, her Mama, her Papi, and their couch are included. Also, this Toys "R" Us exclusive version comes with three bonus figures--Diego, Boots, and Swiper. Additional accessories and furniture must be purchased separately. Still, from the ringing doorbell to the oven that lights up and talks, la casa de Dora es espl&#xE9;ndida. When open, the house is three feet wide by one and a half feet tall.--Emilie Coulter ;
