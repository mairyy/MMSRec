Title: King of Tokyo Power Up Expansion Game ; Description: With King of Tokyo: Power Up. an expansion for the King of Tokyo base game, after choosing a monster each player takes the eight Evolution cards associated with that monster shuffles those cards and creates a personal deck. At the end of a player's turn if she has three hearts she draws one Evolution card and adds it to her hand; this is possible even in Tokyo (when hearts are normally useless) and even if the hearts are used for some other action such as healing. A player can reveal and play an Evolution card at any time. Some Evolutions are temporary allowing a one-time bonus while others are Permanent such as Gigazaur's Tail Sweep which allows him to change one die to a 1 or 2 each turn. Each Evolution card also identifies whether a monster is a Mutant Invader or Robot and while not relevant for Power Up. this species identification could come into play in future expansions. The rules for King of Tokyo: Power Up. contain a few variants: Players start with a random Evolution in play or draw two cards and choose the one they want or draft a set of Evolutions prior to the start of play. However you play the goal of the game remains the same: Score 20 points or be the last monster standing amid the rubble of what was once Tokyo. ;
