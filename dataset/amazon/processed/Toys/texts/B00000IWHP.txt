Title: Pretty Pretty Princess Dress-Up Board Game ; Description: There's a charming simplicity in this game for little ones who dream of  being a princess. Players move their pieces around the game board collecting  plastic costume jewelry, such as rings, earrings, necklaces, and bracelets. The  winner of the game is the one who collects the crown and all the jewels that  match their playing color. That player is the princess who now turns over the  spinner to reveal a mirror into which she can gaze at her royal self. Game play  includes the dreaded black ring, which no one wants but someone might get.  Sticky jewels are included to decorate the jewelry box and the crown. For young  children with royal fantasies, Pretty Pretty Princess is pretty pretty good.--Lee Strucker ;
