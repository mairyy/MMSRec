Title: Fibber Board Game ; Description: In Fibber, it&#x2019;s not what you play; it&#x2019;s what you say. Simply play cards in order and say what you&#x2019;re playing. If you don&#x2019;t have the next card, fib &#x2013; but don&#x2019;t get caught, or you&#x2019;ll earn a nosepiece and your nose will &#x201C;grow.&#x201D; When there are no more noses left, the player with the shortest nose wins. ;
