Title: Pretend and Learn Cash Register ; Description: This pretend cash register may seem like all fun and games to your little one but is actually teaching him coin and money values, coin identification, numbers, counting, and quantities. The register comes with a stack of play pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters, all encased in easy-to-handle plastic chips. In explore mode, the smart coin reader on the register identifies all coins as kids drop them in, teaching their name and value. Four additional price tags represent larger monetary values and as kids slide price tags over the flashing scanner or drop coins in the register, they learn how to add values together and make totals. Kids can also set the register to price check mode to play a fun game that teaches number identification. Final checkout reinforces numbers, coins, and coin combinations once again and plays a fun song when the register opens. Throughout playtime, kids will receive encouragement and requests to keep playing from the LeapFrog's friendly voice.--Cristina Vaamonde ;
