Title: Disney Mack Truck Playset ; Description: Inspired by the hit Disney/Pixar move, Cars, the Mack Truck Bachelor Pad Playset expresses the racy personality of Lightning McQueen, the leading car in the film. In the movie, McQueen gets waylaid on his way to a big race, and ends up in Radiator Springs. It's a little run down for this flashy hot rod, but the eccentric small-town folk-mobiles teach McQueen all about friends, family and love. Now kids can bring these loveable characters home and recreate their favorite scenes from the movie with this detailed playset. The playset opens to reveal a truck bed pad packed with play features (including a carwash, a video game area, a weighing scale and more), where McQueen&#8482; crashes after a long day of racing. Lightning McQueen vehicle sold separately. ;
