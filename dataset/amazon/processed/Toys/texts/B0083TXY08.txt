Title: Nerf Vortex Pyragon Blaster ; Description: It's time to take your Vortex  battling to the next level with the Pyragon  blaster. With a 40-Disc drum magazine, the Pyragon  blaster is the highest-capacity Vortex  blaster yet. Slide the blaster's Slam Fire handle repeatedly while you hold down the trigger to unleash an all-out multi-disc assault. The drum magazine works with other magazine-fed Vortex  blasters (sold separately), and the blaster's revolutionary XLR Disc Tech hurls the bright orange Vortex  discs an ultra-long distance. Attach Tactical Rail accessories (sold separately) to the tactical rail for awesome upgrades. For the final word in Vortex  blaster technology, you need the rapid-fire power of the Pyragon  blaster. ;
