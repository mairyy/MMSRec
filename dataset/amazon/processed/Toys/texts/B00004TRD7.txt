Title: Electronic Talking Silly 6 Pins by hasbro ; Description: Sally, Stevie, Stanley, Sophie, Stewie, and Sid are six colorful, lightweight bowling pins--each with their own personality--that talk to kids while they bowl. Taunts such as "C'mon!  Roll the ball already!" get kids started, and phrases such as "Whew!  That was close," keep them aiming for the pins. Bells, whistles, and cheers are heard if a spare or strike is bowled. The tan plastic base has six colored circles to hold the pins in place, but it is not required that colors match up for a game to begin. Silly 6 Pins only keeps score one frame (two balls) at a time, so keep a pad of paper nearby if you're playing as a family. Three AA batteries are required, but not included.--Pam Lauer ;
