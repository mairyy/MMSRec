Title: Mancala For Kids ; Description: It's called Mancala For Kids, but, aside from having the  traditional playing stones shaped into plastic animal forms, it's a  surprisingly elegant version of the centuries-old pebble-snatching  pursuit. With its clasped and hinged board fashioned of solid hardwood,  this game's equipment is finer than many deluxe sets on the market, and  the simple classic rules are intact. Two players still scoop out stones  from one of their wells, dropping one in each subsequent pocket and  trying to collect opposing pieces. So, go ahead and call it Mancala For  Kids--at least until your little opponent scoops up all your doggies,  fishies, and widdle turtles and wins the game.--Tony Mason ;
