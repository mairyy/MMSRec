Title: Go Away Monster ; Description: Designed for competitive or cooperative play, Go Away Monster  is a delightful game for pre-school-age children. It gives them power  over fears they might have as they "rid their rooms" of scary monsters.  By providing each of up to four players with his or her own playing  board--designed to look like a child's room--the game cunningly avoids  potential squabbles over sharing. Players take turns reaching into a  "monster bag" and feeling for pieces of furniture needed for their  rooms. If they pull out a monster instead, they can hide it or throw it  away while shouting "Go away, monster!" Players may help one another or  compete to finish their rooms first.--Lee Strucker ;
