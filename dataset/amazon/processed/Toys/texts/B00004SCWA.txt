Title: Little Tikes Deluxe Cozy Convertible Car ; Description: If you cross a red car with a plastic boat and combine the result with  one of those big Victorian baby carriages, you get this entirely novel mode of  tot transportation. This little car--32 inches long by 18 inches wide, and  riding on 7-inch plastic wheels--has an integral plastic seat 9 inches off the  ground and can be powered by two little feet through the hole in the floor.  Alternatively, raise the bandshell-style yellow nylon hood and push your  preschooler around using the 38-inch-high metal handle that sticks up from  behind. The "cockpit" is fully equipped with steering wheel, beeping "horn," an  ignition key that turns, a gear shift, and various battery-powered sound  effects. Adult assembly is required.--Richard Farr ;
