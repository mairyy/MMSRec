Title: Schleich Tyrannosaurus Rex ; Description: Tyrannosaurus rex was a fierce predator that walked on two powerful legs. This meat-eater had a huge head with large, pointed, replaceable teeth and well-developed jaw muscles. It had tiny arms, each with two fingers. Each bird-like foot had three large toes, all equipped with claws (plus a little dewclaw on a tiny, vestigial fourth toe). T. rex had a slim, stiff, pointed tail that provided balance and allowed quick turns while running. T. rex's neck was short and muscular.  This hand painted replica comes equipped with booklet containing  scientific data about Tyrannosaurus Rex and a figure of  a human in the same scale, to facilitate comparison of the size. Sculpted in close cooperation with the Natural History Museum of the Humboldt-University Berlin. ;
