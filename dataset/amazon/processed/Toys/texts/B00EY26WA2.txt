Title: Disney Frozen Olaf Doll ; Description: In the Disney film Frozen, Elsa brings the lovable snowman, Olaf, to life with her magical powers. Now girls can also bring him to "life" with this delightful snowman figure. Just like in the movie, Olaf falls apart, with a head that pops off and removable arms. Re-arrange his parts however you want to build your own snowman. To add to the storytelling fun, Olaf changes his facial expressions, with just a press of a button. Ages 3 and older. ;
