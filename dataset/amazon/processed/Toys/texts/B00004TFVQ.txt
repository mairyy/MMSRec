Title: Discover Sounds Kitchen ; Description: Play kitchens are favorite toddler toys, but they often take up a  tremendous amount of space. This scaled-down version provides all sorts of fun  activities and fits neatly in even the smallest of rooms. The unit itself stands  approximately 16.5 inches tall, 22 inches wide, and 8.5 inches deep. There's a  refrigerator with a bright yellow door that has a shape sorter on the outside:  insert the shapes, then push the button, and the shapes drop into the waiting  pot just like an icemaker dispensing ice. Open the refrigerator drawer and just  look at all the (sticker) food on the pretend shelves! The red microwave and  white oven have functional, bright green doors. A purple sink and countertop  sport a white faucet and blue burner. Turn the yellow timer knob below the  burner and the timer ticks and rings. Set the included, smiling orange frying  pan on the burner and the imaginary food immediately starts to sizzle. Place the  smiling green pot on the stove and listen to pretend water bubble and boil. Also  included are an oversized measuring spoon and spatula, a phone with a wall  bracket, and three plastic shapes for the shape sorter/ice dispenser. Let's get  cooking!--Tami Horiuchi ;
