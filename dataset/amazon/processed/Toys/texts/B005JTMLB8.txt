Title: Chuggington Wooden Railway Hoot and Toot ; Description: Hoot and Toot are brother and sister and have two very distinct personalities. Toot is more of the leader while her brother, Hoot, tends to follow along. They disagree often on how to follow the rules which seems to get them into trouble from time to time. They are joined back-to-back, but in some episodes, by strong pulling, they manage to separate.  Chuggington Wooden Railway combines the charm of wooden train play with the exciting world of Chuggington! Easy-to-connect magnets are simple to connect to other vehicles. Chuggington Wooden Railway is compatible with other wooden track systems. ;
