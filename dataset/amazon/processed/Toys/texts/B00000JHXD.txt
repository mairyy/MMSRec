Title: Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Percy The Small Engine ; Description: Peep-peep! Here comes Percy the little steam engine from the ever-popularThomas the Tank Engine and Friendsbook series and television'sShining Time Station(based on The Railway Series by Reverend W. Awdry). With its rounded corners and larger features, this chunky-styled Percy is designed for little hands. Made of lightweight plastic and sporting rubber-trimmed tires, Percy, the youngest and most eager engine in the station, heads off down the tracks with his traditional three-dimensional smiling face. A rear coupling prong allows Percy to pull freight and passenger cars of his same chunky style. The 4.5-inch-by-2.5-inch engine has an axle width of 1.75 inches and fits plastic tracks designed for the My First Thomas train series. This toy does not fit the standard 1.5-inch wooden tracks.--Kathryn Gustafson ;
