Title: Trix Rattle ; Description: Six bright triangles are linked together with a strong, stretchy string. Baby can twist and turn this  rainbow of tiny triangles into a ring that looks like a flower petal or a pyramid, or baby can simply chew on  them. They are made of smooth wood and finished with nontoxic, long-lasting materials that guarantee a  long life for the toy.  And the toy also makes a soft rattle when it's shaken.--Sally James ;
