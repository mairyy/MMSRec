Title: Little Tikes Double Easel ; Description: Just like any great artist, your little one should be prepared  for that moment when creative inspiration arrives. Featuring a large  chalkboard on one side and a blank pad of paper on the other, this  Double Easel will ensure that your pintsize Van Gogh can capture a  moment of inspiration before it passes. The Double Easel is made of  durable plastic and comes with wide trays on both sides for storing art  supplies (not included), as well as a large piece of chalk and an  eraser (included). A large plastic clamp on one side of the easel holds  down a 50-sheet pad of paper (included), and the two storage trays are  removable for easy cleanup. Designed for use by one or two children at  a time, the Double Easel folds together for compact storage. Measures  43.5 inches tall.--Chris Burns ;
