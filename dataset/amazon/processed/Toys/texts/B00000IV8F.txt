Title: Lauri Toys Primer Pak ; Description: Don't underestimate the amount of creative, educational, quiet play packed into this compact travel kit by Lauri. Kids can use the 25-piece "locktagon" construction set to build imaginative shapes and structures. Three lacing and tracing cards come with long, grippable threads to keep hands and eyes busy. A 27-piece puzzle teaches kids letters and their sequence in the alphabet. The pieces to four round, "fit-a-space puzzles" help children learn their shapes while doubling as fun pieces to string together. The tracing cards are made of durable chipboard while the rest of the kit is created from a nearly indestructible bumpy crepe rubber that's fun to touch and manipulate. With its handy rubber handle and Velcro-fastened lid, the kit is fun to tote along to Grandma's house, restaurants, or on long vacation trips. Don't worry about losing pieces; Lauri will mail replacement pieces to you for 50 cents each.--Joan DeClaire ;
