Title: Unfortunate Expeditions (Gloom) ; Description: In the Gloom card game, you make your eccentric family of misfits suffer the greatest tragedies possible before helping them pass on to the well-deserved respite of death. Just mix the 55 transparent cards in this set together with your copy of Gloom to add morbid new Modifiers, Events, and Untimely Deaths, and a new family of intrepid explorers who've faced misfortune across the globe. These days Colonel Bumpersnoot is really more of a bargain hunter, while Lady Bumpersnoot struggles with high society -- but she always loves to have guests for dinner. Their Towering Treehouse is included as a Residence card to use with the Unhappy Homes expansion.Unfortunate Expeditions introduces Expeditions into the game. Set the new Expedition cards to one side. When you play a Modifier or Untimely Death with an Expedition symbol, resolve the immediate effects of the card, then place that Expedition in the center of the table. Only one Expedition can be in play at a time, so it replaces the current Expedition, if there is one. An Expedition's rules affect all players as long as it's in play. Some cards also have special effects that occur if a particular Expedition is already in play when they're played.Adds 1 player. 55 transparent cards in a tuckbox. ;
