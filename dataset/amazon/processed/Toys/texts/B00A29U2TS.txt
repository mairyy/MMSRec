Title: Metro Mags Clear Colors 100 Piece Set ; Description: Metro Mags 3D Magnetic Building Tiles  by Metro Fulfillment HouseMetro Mags magnetic tiles engage children of all ages from 3 years old and up in creative play while building math, logic, and problem solving skills. The square and triangle-shaped tiles attract on all sides and in all combinations, helping children move from 2D to 3D structures as they explore. The transparent tiles feature bright colors that add visual appeal to the creations. Ideal for children at multiple ages and stages, the blocks can be used to form basic shapes that evolve into complex structures.Infinite PossibilitiesMetro Mags building tiles include a combination of equilateral and isosceles triangles and two sizes of square tiles. Each tile allows children to explore different angles in both 2D and 3D. Kids will move from arranging the tiles on the floor like classic pattern blocks to taking their creations into three dimensions--from basic cubes and prisms to complex 3D shapes. Because the blocks attract magnetically, Metro Blocks allow  children as young as three to build successfully. The infinite options and intrigue of magnetism will continue to engage older children and even adults.An Enduring ToyUnlike other building sets that are designed to build one eventual structure, Metro Mags can be used to form virtually any creation--making them a long lasting learning toy. The bright, transparent colors are equally attractive to boys and girls, and kids will find many ways to combine them with their other play things. Whether they forming a princess castle, a bridge, a volcano, or a dollhouse--with Metro Blocks, "if you can dream it, you can build it."What's in the Box?Set of 60 square and triangle shaped magnetic Metro Mags tiles and "Metro Mags Simple Project Guide" ;
