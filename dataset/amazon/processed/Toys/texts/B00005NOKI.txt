Title: LeapFrog MyFirst LeapPad Learning System- &quot;Pooh's Honey Tree&quot; ; Description: Made just for toddlers, My First LeapPad Book takes care to encourage  prereading skills while giving tots a simple, interesting story that makes  learning to read a fun first experience. Just stick the included book chip into  your child's LeapPad, put the book in place, and the LeapPad takes care of the  rest.Pooh is the main character in this story, adding even more appeal as he  seeks out his prized honey tree and, unbeknownst to him, the bees that go with  it. As Pooh goes on his quest, kids learn to comprehend the story's overall  meaning, understand events, and practice their listening skills. Flip the book  over and there are 30 Pooh-themed activities and 5 songs featured, which teach  colors, shapes, and object matching. It even sneaks in a bit of deductive logic  and emotional exploration. Note: The book works only with the My First LeapPad  Learning System, not more advanced LeapPad systems.--Diane Beall ;
