Title: My First Bubble Blower ( colors may vary) ; Description: Toddlers are fascinated by bubbles but often get frustrated when they are not yet skilled enough to blow them themselves. My First Bubble Blower lets kids control the release of bubbles into the air by pulling down on the handle of the bubble container. In addition to being entertaining, this bubble toy is educational as it teaches action/reaction response. The bubble container is spill proof and won't leak if accidentally knocked over. A small window in the side of the container lets adults monitor when the blower needs refilling. Bubble solution goes into the screw top bubble refill chamber on the side. The chamber is rather narrow and may require adults to siphon bubble solution in with a funnel to avoid spilling it down the side of the blower. This toy comes with a bottle of nontoxic, dye-free bubble liquid and operates on two AA batteries (not included).--Cristina Vaamonde ;
