Title: Little Tikes: Grill N' Glow BBQ ; Description: Ah, even in inclement weather, it can be summertime in the playroom. And what's more summery than the age-old tradition of charring goodies over a flame? This toy barbecue grill for tots makes sizzling and grilling sounds, and has a bed of red "coals" that light up. A toy burger, drumstick, sesame seed buns, and veggies can be flipped with a spatula (all included) on the toy range, which has a lift-up lid, pushcart handle, storage space, and wheels. The grill is hollow, lightweight, and attracts the eye with primary colors. It's perfect for kids 2 to 4 years old, but please remind them that the grill does not work with real food--or fire, for that matter. Three AAA batteries, and adult assembly, required.--Diane Beall ;
