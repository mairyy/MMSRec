Title: Transformers Deluxe Bumblebee ; Description: Fallback has never been particularly interested in following the rules. The fastest way between two points, after all, is a straight line. Given a destination, Fallback will gladly drive straight to it, smashing through or knocking over anything that gets in his way. Turn the tables on enemy forces when you throw this warrior into the fight! Press the button to reveal this figure&#x2019;s robot allegiance and then prepare him for a battle. Your Fallback figure is dedicated to destroying any opponent and his dual pistols and robot-mounted rifle will help you two get the job done. If robot combat turns into a car chase, convert your warrior into 4x4 truck vehicle mode, attach his rifle and send him racing off to rule the road! Battle-ready robot-to-vehicle figure converts from robot mode to 4x4 truck vehicle mode &#x2014; and back again! Figure features dual pistols and a rifle that mounts on truck or robot! Press the button to reveal the figure&#x2019;s Autobot or Decepticon allegiance! ;
