Title: Melissa &amp; Doug 200 Wood Block Set ; Description: This 200-piece set takes the blah out of blocks, especially for kids who create best with lots of pieces, lots of color, and lots of space. Kids (those 3- to 7-years-old) will not be hindered by a lack of material for their castles, bridges, fortresses, towers, and houses. There is an abundance of sizes and shapes, including a greater proportion of squares and triangles--the foundation of any building project. The lightweight, wooden pieces are coated with shiny, nontoxic enamel paint (red, yellow, blue, and green) that resists chipping. The box, however, is not as resistant. It has a carrying handle, but grownups should find a more rugged storage container for so many blocks, which are bound to otherwise end up all over the house.--Diane Beall ;
