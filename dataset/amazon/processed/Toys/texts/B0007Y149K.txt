Title: Baby Annabell Function Doll ; Description: Just like a real baby, the all-new Baby Annabell must be lovingly cared for and looked after. Baby Annabell responds to sounds and motions. When she is drinking from her bottle, she makes realistic mouth movements and sucking noises. When you rub her tummy, she burps. She also babbles, giggles, closes her eyes, yawns and makes little snoring sounds. Baby Annabell measures approximately 18" long. Requires 4 "AA" batteries (not included). ;
