Title: Disney Sofia The First Royal Bed Playset ; Description: Disney Sofia the First Royal Bed Playset: Based on the hit new animated series from Disney Junior, Sofia the First. Every princess needs her beauty sleep and this is the perfect spot for the loveable Sofia the First to lay her princess head. Dressed in a sweet nightgown and wearing her signature purple amulet, Sofia is ready to end the day in royal style. Her canopy bed is majestic with tall "wooden" posts, "gilded" accents on top and a translucent, glittery pink canopy with charming molded draping. Girls can open the pink bed, with its matching pillow, to tuck in a 3-inch Sofia small doll for a night of sweet dreams. Sofia can snuggle with her beloved rag doll and two of her adorable animal friends: Clover the Rabbit or Robin the Robin. Her royal bedroom also includes a "wooden" chest for her animal friends to sleep and play in. To expand the fun, both the Sofia doll and Clover the Rabbit figure also unlock phrases in Sofia the First's Magical Talking Castle, sold separately. Girls simply place the dolls on the "magic" base in the castle to activate. Sofia's royal bedroom set includes the canopy bed, trunk, Sofia doll, Clover the Rabbit and Robin the Robin figures and small rag doll accessory. Collect all your favorite Sofia the First Dolls and Playsets to build the ultimate Enchancia kingdom (each sold separately). ;
