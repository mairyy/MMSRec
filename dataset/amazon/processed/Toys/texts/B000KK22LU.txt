Title: Slingshot Flying Pig With Oink Sound ; Description: They work like a slingshot and scream while flying. They are approximately 9" long and fly well over 50 feet. The harder you pull back, the further they will fly. Slingshot Pig flies with a oinking sound! The Slingshot Flying Pig is nothing short of outrageous! The Pig can be shot long distances using his elastic arms. Put one finger in each of the hands' pockets, pull back and let go. The soft, furry Pig is funny with its big head and bulging eyes. As an added bonus, every time you shoot him, he lets out three loud oinking sounds. We don't know why he does this, he just does. If your office or home needs some seriously funny props, you'll love the Slingshot Flying Pig. ;
