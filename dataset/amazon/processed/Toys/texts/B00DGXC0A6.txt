You'll be fascinated as it oozes, moves, and melts right before your eyes - just like a slow-moving liquid. Great for children and adults, at home or in the office. You'll never put it down (Trust us - we can't either!) Aside from playing with it every chance we get, we found that SAND is also great for: Goofing off in the office; Distracting co-workers; Building castles; Making shapes and faces; Writing messages; Reducing stress. It won't make a mess and never dries out. SAND is kinetic - that means it's designed to stick to itself but not to you. It flows through your fingers just like wet sand, but leaves them completely dry and mess-free. And no matter how you pull, stretch and separate SAND (even if some gets on the floor), it always recombines easily. No vacuum cleaners or mops needed. But here's the best part: when you're ready to break out the SAND again, it's just the same as it was when it came out of the jar. It never dries out and needs no liquid additives. If it does get wet, just let it dry out before playing with it again. It's that easy. You've seen it before, but you've never felt anything like it. ;
