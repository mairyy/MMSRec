With a textured button on the front that releases the shutter and large buttons on the back that let little hands turn the camera on and off, browse through pictures and delete images, using this camera is so easy it doesn't need to come with instructions.The fun, brightly colored body helps distinguish this camera from boring adult models, making it an instant favorite.Kid-Friendly TechnologyKids can pick between using the live view on a 1.5-inch color LCD preview screen or looking through the two-eye viewer when taking pictures. The preview screen also lets kids look at pictures the moment after they take them. With a built-in flash that automatically illuminates darkened scenes, and a shutter noise that makes it easy to know when a picture has been taken, kids are sure to be delighted by their images.The 64 MB built-in memory stores up to 500 pictures and eliminates the need for handling fragile and expensive memory cards. Two image resolution settings, 0.3 and 1.3 interpolated mega pixels, let kids take plenty of pictures and make 4 x 6-inch prints.Fun, Durable Way to Encourage CreativityWith its big rubberized grips and sturdy construction, we found this camera lived up to its incredibly durable reputation. Able to easily withstand being dropped again and again and waterproof for 30 minutes in up to three feet of water, this camera can handle the rough reality of active play.The heavy-duty construction that makes this camera so durable can also make it seem somewhat bulky for little hands, but this won't prevent kids from wanting to take it on all their adventures.Older children and adults may be disappointed by the image quality, but higher resolutions would allow less pictures to be stored and decrease the amount of fun children have with this camera. Kids quickly find that there's plenty of resolution for exercising creative urges and documenting the wonders of everyday life.The camera comes with a USB cable so pictures can be downloaded quickly and easily for editing and viewing. It is compatible with Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Apple Mac OSX, Apple Mac OS9 and requires a USB port 1.1 or higher for computer connectivity.What's in the BoxKid Tough Camera, USB cable, user's manual. ;
