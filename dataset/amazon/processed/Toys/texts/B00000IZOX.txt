Title: Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Melody Push Chime ; Description: Another Fisher-Price classic, the Push Toy Melody Push Chime is a little chime-filled drum on wheels (with attached handle) that rings and jingles as your little one rolls it along. Brightly colored, with a menagerie of musical animals on the drum, the Melody Push Chime makes walking for beginners fun. As with all Fisher-Price toys, it's built to take a pounding from exuberant toddlers. This is pretty much standard-issue equipment for children.--Chris Livesay ;
