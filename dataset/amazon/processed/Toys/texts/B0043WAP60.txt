Then, press her tongue to make her new teeth &#x201C;magically&#x201D; appear. &#x201C;Feed&#x201D; her a teething cookie and watch her &#x201C;take a bite&#x201D;. Let her &#x201C;drink&#x201D; from her bottle and change her diaper after she &#x201C;wets&#x201D; it. Then, help her brush her teeth with her toothbrush and toothpaste that squeezes out. It&#x2019;s up to you to teach your baby doll how important it is to take care of her teeth, just like a real mommy does.
