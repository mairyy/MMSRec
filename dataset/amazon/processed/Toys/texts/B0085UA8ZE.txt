Title: Playskool Poppin' Park Learn 'N Pop Lion Toy ; Description: The Learn N Pop Lion toy helps introduce your child to numbers, counting and language through unpredictable ball popping fun. As your little one "feeds" the balls into the lion&#x2019;s mouth, it counts. The balls pop out so your little one can chase them and then put them back in the lio'&#x2019;s mouth or belly. The toy's music and lights stimulate the sense while it counts in 4 languages, so your child gets to experience numbers and language in a fun, stimulating, ball popping way. ;
