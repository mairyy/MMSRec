Title: PowerMax Ultimate Robotic Vehicle ; Description: This is one of those toys that you wish you had as a kid. Working on four C batteries (not included), the Rescue Heroes Ultimate Rescue Vehicle can do just about anything young imaginations dream up. Attached to its back with a coil cord is a remote control that allows kids to move it forward, backward, left, or right. The control also has two green buttons that create sound effects, and a red knob that maneuvers the robot's right arm, which has a clawlike hand for picking up or removing obstacles. Features on the robot itself include a winch attached at the left hand, which can be deployed by the push of a button and wound back up with the blue crank handle; a button that raises the torso of the robot to "maximum body extension" for those out-of-reach rescues; a button that pops the robot's head up and turns on a bright spotlight; and a flip-down platform in the back that can carry a Rescue Hero to the scene. Added cool factor: when you place a Voice Tech Rescue Hero (sold separately) in the robot's cockpit, the URV will recognize them and call them by name.--Pam Lauer ;
