Title: Alhambra Family Box ; Description: In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.On a player's turn, a player may take money from the open money market, purchase a building from the building market, or engage in construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's reserve. Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for the longest external wall section within a complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.The Family Box comes with two expansions: "The Vizier's Favor" and "Granada"."The Vizier's Favor" expansion adds 4 new modules to Alhambra:1. The primary module is "The Vizier's Favor", which allows players to buy a building out of turn, but has to be paid with the exact amount.2. "The Builders Huts" introduces a number of new tiles that only count in the scoring when other tiles of the same color are built next to them. Hut tiles are free, but their number is limited to three per player.3. With the "The Currency Exchange", players can buy building tiles by mixing different currencies.4. The fourth module is a set of bonus cards that are dealt to the players. Each of the tiles shows a particular building. If the matching building is part of your Alhambra, then the bonus card can be revealed and will count as another building of that category."Granada" is a standalone game in which players buy building tiles to construct the city of Granada and earn the most victory points. Building tiles now have two sides and there are new building types, for which the value is set during the game.Includes rules in English, German, and Spanish. ;
