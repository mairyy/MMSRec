Title: Little Tikes Disc Swing ; Description: Kid-friendly (and safety-minded) toy-maker Little Tikes has taken a  backyard classic--the good ol' rope swing--and made it that much better: instead  of an uncomfortable knot or threadbare tire, kids weighing up to 100 pounds can  swing from this smooth, foot-wide, rugged plastic disc, built to rotate in every  direction. A raised neck in the center of the swing helps protect young legs,  and the set comes with 12 feet of strong, weather-resistant rope to rig the disc  up from a tree or swing set.--Paul Hughes ;
