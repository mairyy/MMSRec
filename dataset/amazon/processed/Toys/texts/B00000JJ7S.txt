Title: LeapFrog Phonics Writing Desk ; Description: This electronic writing desk teaches kids the alphabet, letter sounds, letter formation,  spelling, and word creation in a fun, interactive format. Kids can choose from six  games: letters, a letters quiz, phonics, a phonics quiz, spelling, and "create-a-word."  In the letters game, children push a letter to hear its name and see how it is formed  on the LCD screen; players can also write their own letters on the "magic" writing screen.  In the spelling game, children learn to spell simple words. In the phonics game, children  first hear a letter and then are given a short word as an example. Along the way, the  always-helpful LeapFrog "coach" offers lots of cheerful hints so children won't get  stuck in any of the exercises. Additional features include an automatic shut-off, an  oversize pullout handle, a variety of comical sounds for incorrect answers, and a  two-position volume control.--Tami Horiuchi ;
