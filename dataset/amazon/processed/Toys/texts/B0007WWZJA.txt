Title: Shake &amp; Go Racers: Raceway Playset ; Description: Finally a racing set that harnesses the raw energetic power of the kids who play with it! This speedway comes with two cars, one red and one blue, which are powered up just by shaking them. Much like soda cans except with wheels and without all that sticky mess. Once the vehicles are ready to go, place them on the track and let them fly. As fun as that propulsion system is, the track is not adaptable to new configuration, which might hurt the prolonged play value of the set. This is mitigated, however, by the fact that the track announces, in an excited voice, which of the cars is in the lead and which actually wins the race. Other race cars for the set are sold separately.--Charlie Williams ;
