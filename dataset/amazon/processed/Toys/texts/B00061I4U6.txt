Title: Mr. Potato Head - Darth Tater ; Description: Be it a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away or right here at home in the 21st century, Mr. Potato Head never fails to reinvent himself. For generations this spectacular spud has wowed us all with his ability to keep up with the times. Now he throws us all for a loop once again to reveal that even he has a Dark Side, taking up&#xA0;the role of the most menacing movie villains of all times: Darth Vader. Donning the trademark black helmet, mask and cape, our favorite tuber wields the&#xA0;infamous red lightsaber to become his own Darth Tater. Of course you&#x92;ll still find all the classic accessories like the googly eyes, red nose, and silly tongue we&#x92;ve come to love but now with an added twist of Star Wars.&#xA0;As always,&#xA0;all the pieces still fit away inside his body for easy storage.--Chip Quinn ;
