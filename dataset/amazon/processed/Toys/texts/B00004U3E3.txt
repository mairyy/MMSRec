Title: ROADMAX Dump Truck ; Description: Designed to handle a long day of moving rocks and sand in the  back yard or hauling toys in the playroom, this kid-powered Roadmax  Dump Truck makes it easy for young builders to get the job done right.  Riding along smoothly on six soft rubber tires, the truck is made of  durable plastic and features smooth rounded edges that will help  prevent minor cuts and bruises when it is being pushed around, loaded,  or unloaded. Along with its eye-catching primary colors and realistic  styling, your toddler will also appreciate the truck's working rear  bucket (that can swivel to dump loads in three different directions)  and the front driver's cab that can hold up to two play figures (sold  separately). The truck measures approximately 14.5 inches long. Other  Roadmax vehicles are sold separately.--Chris Burns ;
