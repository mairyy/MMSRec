Title: Ty Beanie Babies - Nanook the Husky [Toy] ; Description: You'll get all mushy for this handsome dog. Nanook was born  November 21, 1996. His poem reads:Nanook is a dog that loves cold weatherTo him a sled is light as a featherOver the snow and through the slushHe runs at hearing the cry of "mush!"This dog is quite tired from running around--which is why he is lying  down. He has a white underbelly, inner ears, face, paws, and tail tip;  everything else is gray. The mouth is black thread. His piercing blue  eyes are a real standout. A favorite with girls and boys (and adults),  he makes a great gift. Surface wash only.--Peggy Etra ;
