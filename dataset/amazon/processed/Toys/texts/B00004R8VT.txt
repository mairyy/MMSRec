Title: Fisher Price Mirror ; Description: Curious babies will find the Sparkling Symphony Mirror to be  captivating and soothing. Create a stimulating interactive environment  in your child's crib or car seat with this toy that features the  classical music of Mozart and Beethoven, three children's songs, and  magical sound effects. Simply attach the toy to the side of your  child's crib using the adjustable straps. For newborns, the mirror can  be set to provide two minutes of uninterrupted lights, sound, and  music. As your baby grows, adjust the unit to the second mode and they  can bat at the rolling music bar for a musical surprise. Either way,  the colorful lights dance around the round safety mirror with the help  of three AA batteries.--Melissa Wilson ;
