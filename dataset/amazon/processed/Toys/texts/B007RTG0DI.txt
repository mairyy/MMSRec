Title: Chameleon Crunch Game ; Description: Chameleon Crunch Game: Chameleon can walk, talk and eat bugs-and he sure is hungry-but he's very picky about the bugs he eats. In the wacky preschool game Chameleon Crunch, players aim to feed this adorable lizard character. Just spread out the bugs, turn him on and watch Chameleon go. Players race to be the first to feed all of their bugs to Chameleon, but they must be careful. Sometimes, the bugs escape and Chameleon needs to be fed all over again. When Chameleon stops, whoever has the most bugs in his mouth wins. Requires 3 AA batteries, not included. ;
