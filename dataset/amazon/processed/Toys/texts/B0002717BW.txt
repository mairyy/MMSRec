Title: My Scene:Masquerade Madness - Butterfly Punk Barbie ; Description: There&#x92;s a party goin&#x92; on at the Party Pad, and everyone&#x92;s invited! In an effort to raise money for a local animal shelter, Barbie, Madison, Chelsea, and the rest of the My Scene gang decide to throw a masquerade party in the DVD movie,Masquerade Madness. And what a party it is! My Scene followers will be thrilled to see this 23-minute DVD, and even happier to find Barbie all dolled up as a very sexy Butterfly Punk, complete with sparkly brown and copper wings, pink faux-fur jacket (at least we hope it&#x92;s faux; itisan animal shelter fund raiser, after all), belly-revealing top with lace front, sleek hip-hugging purple and pink camo cargo pants, and spiky high heel boots. Plus she has a costumed puppy, lots of accessories, and a whole other outfit, presumably for the after-party party. You fly, girl! Warning: Girls, don&#x92;t try these outfits at home--you&#x92;ll be grounded for a month!--Emilie Coulter ;
