Title: Fisher-Price Little People Lil' Movers Airplane ; Description: "Ready for take-off&#x85;here we go!" Diminutive pilots in training can let their imagination take flight with this stocky, swooshy, wiggly-wobbly airplane. Measuring 12 inches nose to tail, and 8 inches from wingtip to wingtip, this sturdy plastic plane features a pilot, two passengers, a piece of luggage, a door that opens, six windows, including the pilot&#x92;s windshield, a handle over the cut-out top, working wheels (which make the pilot and passengers go up and down as if encountering turbulence), and the obligatory face on the front of the craft. Push down on the pilot in her seat (yes,herseat&#x85;we are in the 21st century, you know!) for flashing lights, a tune, flight attendant commentary, and swooshing airplane sounds. Judging from the outfits of the passengers and the palm tree design on the wings, this aircraft seems to be headed for a tropical port--airport, that is. What&#x92;s not to love? Check out the entire line of Lil&#x92; Movers vehicles.  Three AA batteries required (not included). (Ages 18 months to 3 years)--Emilie Coulter ;
