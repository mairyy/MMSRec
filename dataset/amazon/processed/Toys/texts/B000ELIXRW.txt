Title: Princess Genevieve Doll - Barbie In The 12 Dancing Princesses ; Description: Capitalizing on the princess passion so many young girls harbor these days, the folks at Universal Studios and Mattel have developed a veritable princess bonanza with the "Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses" dolls and DVD. Not to be confused (or linked too closely) with the Brothers Grimm fairy tale of the same name, this story deals with a dozen princesses who are taught royal etiquette by a duchess who does not believe in fun and games. Genevieve (played by that star of stage and screen, Barbie) and her sisters find a way to bring dancing and joy back into their lives. The glamorous Genevieve doll is sure to spark hours of imaginary playtime among girls, whether they&#x92;ve seen the movie or not. Genevieve&#x92;s skirt is a froth of pink and gold that actually spins and lights up! Her adorable little kitten accompanies Genevieve/Barbie, and is decked out in her own rose-colored gown and gold crown. Requires two "AAA" batteries (not included). Other sisters are sold separately.--Emilie Coulter ;
