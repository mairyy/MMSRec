Title: Valve, Portal Weighted Companion Cube Plushie ; Description: Straight from the Vital Apparatus Vent comes the Weighted Companion Cube Plush. It will accompany you through the test chamber and generally be adorable and squishy. We expect you will take care of it while it is in your possession. The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube Plush cannot speak, threaten you, or stab you. (That paranoia you feel is totally normal.) In the event that the Weighted Companion Cube does speak, we urge you to disregard its advice, especially if said advice pertains to the veracity of cake.The best thing about the Weighted Companion Cube Plush is that you never have to euthanize it. That's right, friends. Unless you happen to have an Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator in your house, there's no reason to incinerate your cute lil' cube friend. (Studies have proven that those 8 out of 10 Aperture Science engineers were wrong and the Weighted Companion Cube does in fact feel pain upon incineration.) You may have incinerated one or two Weighted Companion Cubes in your time, but now is time for penance. Squeeze it, feed it cake, and love it long time. ;
