Title: Melissa &amp; Doug Let's Play House! Vacuum Up Playset ; Description: Who left these shapes all over the floor? Time to vacuum them up! Six painted wooden pieces (pretzel, peanut, bandage, coin, cereal Os' and a lost diamond ring) are a much cuter version of the everyday messes that parents know all too well. Pass this clever "vacuum" overtop and they are swept into a compartment inside. Ready to play again? Open up the back panel, pull out the pieces and make another fun-filled "mess"! ;
