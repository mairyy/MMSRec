Title: Disney/Pixar Cars RS500 1/2 Off-Road Rally Race Trackset ; Description: Disney/Pixar&#x2019;s Cars movies thrill kids with amazing racing action and adventure. In the next toon in the series, RS500 1/2, racer Lightning McQueen is challenged by 4 new, off-road characters to brave very tough terrain. Will he be able to keep up? Will he survive the race? Who will win? Recreate key scenes with this set featuring an Action Shifters lever for kid-powered interactive play. Using the lever, kids start the race by sending cars climbing up the steep, rocky hill. They&#x2019;ll have to navigate the crazy, rough road below that includes a cactus patch, a graveyard and a scary forest. Kids decide when to end the race, too: they activate the trap door and send the vehicles down into Tailpipe Cavern and on to the finish line.  This dynamic set connects to other Action Shifters sets, so kids can build out the entire world of Radiator Springs. Comes with favorite character, Lightning McQueen in his new off-road deco and also works with most 1:55 scale die-cast cars. Each sold separately. Ages 3 and older. ;
